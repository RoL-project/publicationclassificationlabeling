0	THIS ARTICLE AIMS, FIRST, TO CLARIFY FICHTE'S JUDGMENT ON MACHIAVELLI, SECOND, TO EXPLAIN THE REASONS FOR THE FORMER'S INTEREST IN THE LATTER WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF LATE EIGHTEENTH- AND EARLY NINETEENTH-CENTURY HISTORY. FICHTE DID NOT ADMIRE MACHIAVELLI FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL OR A RELIGIOUS, BUT FROM A MORAL PERSPECTIVE. THE ONE-SIDEDNESS AND BLINDNESS OF THE AUTHOR OF THE PRINCE DID NOT PREVENT FICHTE FROM ENDORSING THE "MORE SERIOUS AND STRONGER" CONCEPTION OF POLITICS ADVOCATED BY HIM: THE WAR IN GERMANY ALONGSIDE THE SUBVERSION OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW MADE IT NECESSARY TO REHABILITATE THE MACHIAVELLIAN RECIPE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF POLITICS. HOWEVER, FICHTE ALSO STRESSED THE LIMITS OF THE MACHIAVELLIAN PROGRAM: MACHIAVELLI ONLY CONSIDERED A SITUATION IN WHICH THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT ASSURED.
1	WHILE IT IS TRUE, AS PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS AND KAREN LAFOLLETE MAINTAIN IN THE CAPITALIST REVOLUTION IN LATIN AMERICA, THAT LATIN AMERICA HAS BEGUN TO BREAK AWAY FROM ITS STATIST TRADITION, THE BASIC CULTURE OF MERCANTILISM, CORPORATISM, AND INTERVENTIONISM REMAINS, UNDERPINNED BY THE POSITIVIST TRADITION THAT HAS MADE PUBLIC POLICY AND LEGISLATION A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE RULE OF LAW, AS REFLECTED IN A SCHEMA OF ESSENTIAL RIGHTS. THE CONFUSION BETWEEN A PRIVATE-ENTERPRISE ECONOMY AND A FREE ECONOMY IS AT THE HEART OF THE FAILURE OF LATIN AMERICA TO CREATE A TRULY COMPETITIVE, PRIVILEGE-FREE, AND INSTITUTIONALLY ADEQUATE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, WHILE THE DIVORCE OF MARKET ECONOMICS FROM THE RULE OF LAW HAS LED TO AN AUTHORITARIANISM THAT HAS UNDERMINED THE TRANSITION FROM A STATE-LED TO A PRIVATE-ENTERPRISE ECONOMY.
2	THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO REVISIT THE THEORIES OF TORT THAT SERVE AS THE FOUNDATION FOR A GUARANTEEING THEORY OF SANCTIONING PUBLIC LAW, INCLUDING, NAMELY, SANCTIONING ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. THROUGH THE DEDUCTIVE METHOD, IT WILL BE CONCLUDED THAT, IN A CONSTITUTIONAL STATE OF LAW, THE PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW ESTABLISHED IN THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION ARE FULLY APPLIED TO ANY PUNITIVE BRANCH OF THE STATE, INSOFAR AS ONTOLOGICAL DISTINCTIONS ARE NOT CONCEIVED BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ILLICIT ACTS EPISTEMOLOGICALLY AFFIRMED BY THE STATE.
3	IN THIS ARTICLE THERE IS AN ANALYSIS OF ARISTOTLE'S VIEWS ON THE BEST GOVERNMENT SYSTEM. SOME ATTENTION IS PAID TO CRITICISM AT PLATO'S PROJECT OF AN IDEAL STATE (PLATO WAS ARISTOTLE'S TEACHER). ALSO, IN THE ARTICLE THERE IS AN ANALYSIS OF THIS THINKER'S STATEMENTS ON THE RIGHT AND WRONG GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS; WE ALSO ELICIT ANY STATE'S AIM AND NATURE, POLITICS' TASKS; IN THE ARTICLE WE DESCRIBE THE PHILOSOPHER'S VIEWS ON THE SLAVEHOLDING SYSTEM AND PRIVATE OWNERSHIP. ARISTOTLE'S POLITICAL AND LEGAL VIEWS FOUND THEIR REFLECTION IN HIS WORKS: "ATHENIAN POLITIA", "NICKOMAKHOV'S ETHICS", "POLITICS". IN ARISTOTLE'S JUDGMENT, THE AIM OF STATE IS COMMON GOOD AND HAPPINESS OF ITS EVERY CITIZEN. AT THE SAME TIME, CITY-STATE (POLIS) IS CONSIDERED AS A POLITICAL COMMUNICATION OF FREE AND EQUAL PEOPLE. THE MOST CORRECT FORM OF GOVERNMENT IS POLITIA WHERE THE MIDDLE CLASS OF PEOPLE PREDOMINATES IN ALL SPHERES, TO BE PRECISE, THE MIDDLE CLASS AS THE MAJORITY RULES IN THE INTERESTS OF COMMON GOOD. POLITIA IS A SPECIFIC KIND OF CONFUSION OF OLIGARCHY AND DEMOCRACY DEPRIVED OF EXTREMES AND DISADVANTAGES. ARISTOTLE WAS ONE OF THE SUPPORTERS OF THE ORGANIC THEORY OF STATE'S ORIGIN; HE POINTED OUT THAT STATE WAS THE PRODUCT OF NATURAL DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS CONDITIONAL ON THE NATURE OF A MAN HIMSELF: "THE MAN IS A POLITICAL AND SOCIAL BEING". THE STATE ITSELF IS THE END OF GENESIS OF THE MAN'S POLITICAL NATURE. ARISTOTLE CRITICIZES PLATO'S PROJECT OF AN IDEAL STATE ("PLATO IS MY FRIEND, BUT I APPRECIATE TRUTH MORE") BECAUSE OF HIS ATTEMPT TO MAKE A STATE " EXCESSIVELY UNITED". SO, COMMUNITY OF OWNERSHIP, WIVES AND CHILDREN PROPOSED BY PLATO WILL RESULT, IN THE LAST ANALYSIS, IN DEGENERATION OF THE STATE ITSELF, THE PHILOSOPHER THOUGHT. PLATO WAS AGAINST PRIVATEOWNERSHIP; HE POINTED OUT THAT "PRIVATE OWNERSHIP IS ROOTED IN THE HUMAN NATURE, IN THE MAN'S LOVE TO HIMSELF". SO FAR AS ARISTOTLE WAS AN ARISTOCRAT, HE HAD RATHER DETERMINED VIEWS ON THE SLAVERY AS WELL. SLAVERY WAS ETHICALLY JUSTIFIED; THE RELATIONS BETWEEN MASTER AND SLAVE HAD A FAMILY NATURE. MOREOVER, THE NOTION OF A CITIZEN ITSELF IS FORMED BY THE PHILOSOPHER FROM THE PERSON'S ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIAL ACTIVITIES OF THE STATE. ARISTOTLE WAS ONE OF THE MOST UNIVERSAL PHILOSOPHERS IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND. THE APPEARANCE OF METAPHYSICS AS A METHOD OF COGNITION AND THE TRADITION OF ATHENIAN SCHOOL - A LYCEUM - ARE CONNECTED EXACTLY WITH HIS NAME NOWADAYS. REALLY, IN ARISTOTLE'S WORKS THERE IS INTERPRETATIONAL SYNTHESIS OF ALL THE ANCIENT THEORIES THAT IS OF ESPECIALLY GREAT INTEREST IN OUR TIME. AS NEVER BEFORE THE CRITICS OF DEMOCRACY IS ACTUAL NOW (IN ARISTOTLE'S VIEW, IT IS ONE OF THE WORST GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS ALONG WITH TYRANNY), IN THE PERIOD OF GLOBAL CRISIS AND FALL OF UNIVERSAL VALUES. THANKS TO HIS INCONTESTABLE AUTHORITY, ARISTOTLE'S VIEWS BECAME STARTING POINTS FOR THE WHOLE POLITICAL AND LEGAL THOUGHT NOT ONLY ON THE WEST, BUT ON THE EAST TOO, RIGHT UP TO THE BEGINNING OF XVIII CENTURY.
4	INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW AS IT IS CURRENTLY BEING TRANSFORMED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) PROVES TO BE AN IDEAL TEST CASE FOR ASSESSING GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM-WHETHER IT IS IN FACT OCCURRING AND, IF SO, THE DIRECTION OF THIS PROCESS. WHILE ECONOMIC RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED BY THE LAWS OF THE EU, MANY OF THESE RIGHTS WERE PROTECTED BY BILATERAL TREATIES BEFORE INTERNAL MECHANISMS EXISTED. THE EU IS NOW DISREGARDING THE PROTECTIONS THAT EXIST OUTSIDE OF THE NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK OF THE EU TREATIES, RESULTING IN CONFLICTING 'CONSTITUTIONAL' RIGHTS. FOLLOWING THE DECISION BY THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IN ACHMEA, THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS IN INTRA-EU INVESTMENT TREATIES ARE NOW CONSIDERED INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE LAWS OF THE EU. THE DECISION WAS BASED ON 'MUTUAL TRUST' AND 'SINCERE COOPERATION' BETWEEN THE MEMBER STATES, POINTING TO FORMALIZED CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES. THESE IDEALS AND THEIR REFLECTION IN THE CHANGING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL POSITIONS OF THE EU TOWARDS INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTES SPEAK TO PERCEPTIONS OF INVESTORS' RIGHTS, AND THUS IMPLY TRANSFORMING IDEAS OF CONSTITUTIONALITY WITH RESPECT TO THOSE RIGHTS. INVESTMENT TRIBUNALS, CONVENED UNDER INTERNATIONAL TREATIES, HOWEVER, HAVE CONTINUED TO UPHOLD A DIFFERENT POSITION REGARDING THE SPECIFIC RIGHTS OF INVESTORS. AN INEVITABLE CONFLICT EMERGES IN THE PROTECTION OF SIMILAR RIGHTS, NAMELY THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN STANDARDS OF TREATMENT AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR PRIVATE INVESTORS, REVEALING AN INCONGRUENCE IN THE REALIZATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES. THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE EXAMINES MORE CLOSELY THE INCOMPATIBILITY OF THESE POSITIONS AND ANALYSES THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE ACTIONS FOR THE PROGRESSION OF A GLOBALLY-RELEVANT CONSTITUTIONALISM.
5	WE INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) ON TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTH EAST ASIAN NATIONS MEMBER COUNTRIES. OUR ANALYSIS UNDERSCORES THE PIVOTAL ROLES THAT FINANCIAL AND GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS PLAY AS MEDIATORS IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FDI AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. OUR EMPIRICAL RESULTS BASED ON THE 25 YEARS PANEL DATASET FROM 1996 TO 2020 REVEAL THAT THE RULE OF LAW, ONE OF THE SUB-INDICATORS OF THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, HAS A SIGNIFICANT MEDIATING EFFECT IN THIS RELATIONSHIP. THOUGH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PLAY A MEDIATING ROLE, FDI NEGATIVELY AFFECTS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND POSITIVELY AFFECTS TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, MEANING THE SUPPRESSION EFFECT. TO MAXIMIZE FDI'S SPILLOVER EFFECTS, GOVERNMENTS SHOULD FACILITATE THE EFFECTIVE FUNCTIONING OF THE RULE OF LAW AND DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO ALLEVIATE FINANCING RESTRICTIONS, WHICH MIGHT HAMPER FDI.
6	KOREANS HAVE WORKED HARD TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THEIR DEMOCRACY. THEY HAVE PROMOTED THE RULE OF LAW, ACCOUNTABILITY, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, FREEDOM, AND RESPONSIVENESS, AND MADE AN EFFORT TO MAKE GOVERNMENT MORE EFFECTIVE. THEY ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO ECONOMIC FREEDOM. IN RELATION TO THE RULE OF LAW, SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO REDUCING TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE, MAKING GOVERNMENT MORE EFFECTIVE, AND ENHANCING REGULATORY QUALITY. HOWEVER, WITH REGARD TO ACCOUNTABILITY, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, AND TRANSPARENCY, KOREA HAS STILL A LONG WAY TO GO. THE ANALYSIS OF DEMOCRATIZATION AND IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY TO DATE SUGGEST THAT KOREA HAS ADAPTED TO THE CHANGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND IS SUSTAINING ITS ECONOMIC GROWTH. THIS HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC POLARIZATION AND A CONSEQUENT DEMAND FOR MORE AND BETTER WELFARE SERVICES.
7	MANY OF THE MOST VISIBLE EXAMPLES OF THE BACKLASH AGAINST MULTILATERALISM, GLOBALIZATION, AND DEMOCRACY DO NOT TARGET FREE TRADE, INVESTMENT, OR ELECTIONS DIRECTLY, BUT THE JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT WERE CREATED TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF TRADERS, INVESTORS, AND CITIZENS. IS THE BACKLASH AGAINST GLOBALIZATION AND DEMOCRACY REALLY A BACKLASH AGAINST THE GROWING IDEOLOGICAL CONVERGENCE ON RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES AS APPROPRIATE STANDARDS FOR BOTH INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC GOVERNANCE? THIS ESSAY SUGGESTS THAT THIS MIGHT BE SO BY HIGHLIGHTING THAT THE RULE OF LAW DOES NOT JUST CONSTRAIN THE POWERFUL, BUT ALSO MAJORITARIAN POLITICS. A NEW DOMESTIC IDEOLOGICAL CLEAVAGE PERMEATES MANY LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES THAT IS IN PART ABOUT LIBERAL CONCEPTIONS OF JUSTICE. AN ILLUSTRATIVE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT ILLIBERAL VIEWS ABOUT JUSTICE ARE NEGATIVELY AND SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH TRUST IN EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS.
8	THE HUNGARIAN JUDICIARY HAS REACTED TO THE POLITICAL CHANGE OF RECENT YEARS IN A TWOFOLD WAY. SOME JUDGES HAVE RESISTED POLITICAL PRESSURE AND DECIDED CASES ACCORDING TO THE LAW AND THEIR CONSCIENCE, WHILE OTHERS, SHOWING THE SIGNS OF JUDICIAL POPULISM, HAVE DEFERRED TO THE INTERESTS OF THE GOVERNMENT. THE PAPER EXPLAINS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THIS TWOFOLD BEHAVIOR AND THE BUREAUCRATIC TRADITION OF THE HUNGARIAN JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT THE BUREAUCRATIC MODEL OF ORGANIZATION HAS CERTAIN FEATURES THAT CAN MAKE JUDGES MORE RESISTANT TO POLITICAL PRESSURE, WHILE OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE MODEL CAN LEAD TO JUDICIAL DEFERENCE. NONETHELESS, THESE LATTER ELEMENTS ARE NOT NECESSARY COMPONENTS OF THE 'WEBERIAN' JUSTICE SYSTEM.
9	TODAY, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT NORMATIVE CONFLICTS ARE AT THE ROOT OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM OF RELIGIOUS SECURITY. THE ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF NORMATIVE CONFLICTS LIE IN THE CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN PARTS OF A SEPARATE SYSTEM OF NORMS AND VALUES, OR BETWEEN NORMATIVE VALUE SYSTEMS OF A DIFFERENT NATURE, BUT INCLUDED IN ONE DOMINANT CULTURE. THE AUTHORS DETERMINE THAT TO ENSURE RELIGIOUS SECURITY, IT IS NECESSARY TO MINIMIZE THE DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS OF NORMATIVE CONFLICTS THROUGH THE REMOVAL OF CONTRADICTIONS. THE STUDY PROPOSES A CLASSIFICATION OF PRACTICES THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO REMOVE THE SEVERITY OF NORMATIVE CONFLICTS, INCLUDING IN THE SPHERE OF THE "SECULAR" - "RELIGIOUS" SEGMENTS. BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL APPROACH, CONFLICT FUNCTIONALISM, AND MARGINAL ANTHROPOLOGY, THE AUTHORS IDENTIFY A SYSTEM OF AUTHORITARIAN AND HUMANISTIC PRACTICES OF RELIGIOUS SECURITY. THE AUTHORITARIAN TYPE OF PRACTICE INCLUDES STIGMATIZATION AND LEGAL PROTECTION OF THE FEELINGS OF BELIEVERS. HUMANISTIC PRACTICES SHOULD INCLUDE TOLERANCE, NONVIOLENCE, AND CALLS FOR A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS. THE CLASSIFICATION OF RELIGIOUS SECURITY PRACTICES IS BASED ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE CONCEPT OF NORM REPRESENTED BY TWO PARADIGMS: CLASSICAL AND NONCLASSICAL. THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT ALL TYPES OF RELIGIOUS SECURITY PRACTICES ARE ACTIVELY USED IN THE MODERN WORLD.
10	TIME TAKES US FURTHER AWAY FROM THE HISTORICAL EVENT - THE FEBRUARY MEETING OF THE PATRIARCH OF MOSCOW AND POPE. IN ITS AFTERMATH EXPECTATIONS OF ALL-ORTHODOX CATHEDRAL WERE HIGH. WHAT PREVENTED THE FORUM, WHICH HAD BEEN EXPECTED FOR MORE THAN 1200 YEARS? IS IT POSSIBLE TO OVERCOME SEEMINGLY INSURMOUNTABLE "DIFFERENCES OF OPINION" WITHIN THE UNIVERSAL ORTHODOXY OF TWO "SUPERCHURCHES": ECUMENICAL PATRIARCHATE AND THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH?
11	THE AUTHOR, WHO WAS A MEMBER OF THE COMMISSION ENTRUSTED BY THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT WITH DRAFTING THE BILL OF JUDICIARY ACT (2012), ANALYZE HOW THE JUDICIARY HAS EVOLVED TO THE LIGHT OF THE LATEST REFORMS, ESPECIALLY UNDER THE PERSPECTIVE OF ITS BODY GOVERNMENT AND THE ELEMENTS THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEFINITION ITS FUNDAMENTAL FEATURES, PARTICULARLY CONSIDERING THE INFLUENCE THAT POLITICAL PARTIES AND ASSOCIATIONS OF JUDGES HAVE HAD IN THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY.
12	MANY YEARS AGO, EMMANUEL TODD CAME UP WITH A CLASSIFICATION OF FAMILY TYPES AND ARGUED THAT THE HISTORICALLY PREVALENT FAMILY TYPES IN A SOCIETY HAVE IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES FOR ITS ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. HERE, WE EVALUATE TODD'S MOST IMPORTANT PREDICTIONS EMPIRICALLY. RELYING ON A PARSIMONIOUS MODEL WITH EXOGENOUS COVARIATES, WE FIND MIXED RESULTS. ON THE ONE HAND, AUTHORITARIAN FAMILY TYPES ARE, IN STARK CONTRAST TO TODD'S PREDICTIONS, ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED LEVELS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND INNOVATION. ON THE OTHER HAND, AND IN LINE WITH TODD'S EXPECTATIONS, COMMUNITARIAN FAMILY TYPES ARE LINKED TO RACISM, LOW LEVELS OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND LATE INDUSTRIALIZATION. COUNTRIES IN WHICH ENDOGAMY IS FREQUENTLY PRACTICED ALSO DISPLAY AN EXPECTEDLY HIGH LEVEL OF STATE FRAGILITY AND WEAK CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS.
13	BOTH POLITICAL SCIENTISTS AND DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS EXPRESS RENEWED INTEREST IN THE 'LOCAL' IN PEACEBUILDING, AND A NEED TO BETTER ENGAGE WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES' CONCERNS, PERSPECTIVES AND CAPACITIES. DEVELOPING SCHOLARSHIP HIGHLIGHTS HOW SUCH DISCOURSES ESSENTIALISE THE 'LOCAL', AND OBSCURE THE ROLE OF INTERVENERS IN ITS CONSTRUCTION. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THINKING IN TERMS OF 'LOCAL' PEACEBUILDING CONFIGURES PARTICULAR UNDERSTANDINGS OF WHAT CONFLICT AND PEACEBUILDING ENTAIL. IT DEPICTS LOCAL CONFLICT AS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED IN ISOLATION, AND NEUTRALISES LOCAL PEACEBUILDING AGENDAS. EXPERIENCES OF COMMUNITY-BASED PEACEBUILDING IN BURUNDI AND EASTERN DR CONGO INSTEAD SHOW 'LOCAL' PEACEBUILDERS' PRAGMATIC EFFORTS TO MOVE BEYOND 'LOCAL' CONFLICT, AND SIGNIFICANT LOCAL CONTESTATION ABOUT THE KINDS OF PEACE, JUSTICE AND SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION ENVISAGED. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT A CONCERN WITH THE 'LOCAL' IN PEACEBUILDING MAY MAKE INTERVENERS GLOSS OVER IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS OF SO-CALLED 'LOCAL' STAKEHOLDERS TO STRUCTURAL PEACE AND STATE-FORMATION, AND SO EFFECTIVELY DISEMPOWER THEM.
14	THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE WILL DISCUSS THE CONDITIONS OF POLAND'S MEMBERSHIP IN THE EU IN THE LIGHT OF THE INTEGRATION CLAUSE LAID DOWN IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND AND IN LIGHT OF THE CASE LAW OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE MIGRATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL IDEAS FROM GERMANY TO POLAND, AS WELL AS THE APPLICATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION BY POLISH STATE AUTHORITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE DISPUTE OVER THE CONTROVERSIAL REFORM OF THE JUDICIARY IN POLAND. IN THIS CONTEXT PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE OF JUDGES IN GERMANY HAVE BEEN ALSO ANALYSED. NEXT, THE ROLE OF THE COURTS IN CONDUCTING EUROPEAN POLICY WILL BE ASSESSED TOGETHER WITH A PROPOSAL TO RESOLVE SYSTEMIC CONFLICTS AT THE EUROPEAN LEVEL.
15	AMONG CONTEMPORARY FORMS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM, LUIGI FERRAJOLI'S GARANTISMO MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THE RATHER UNFASHIONABLE ATTEMPT TO BUILD UP A COMPREHENSIVE AND MULTI-LAYERED THEORY, WHICH STILL TAKES SERIOUSLY THE POSITIVIST HERITAGE. THIS PAPER OFFERS, IN BRIEF OUTLINE, A SYNTHETIC VIEW OF THE SOCIAL SETTING, THE PHILOSOPHICAL BACKGROUND, AND THE BASIC FEATURES OF THIS CONCEPTION OF CONSTITUTIONALISM, WHEN COMPARED WITH LEGAL POSITIVISM AND OTHER MAINSTREAM FORMS OF (NEO)CONSTITUTIONALISM.
16	OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, SOUTH AFRICA HAS EXPERIENCED ISOLATED TERRORIST ATTACKS AND AT TIMES SERVED AS A HUB FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ACTIVITY, PARTICULARLY AS A CONDUIT FOR ILLICIT FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS AND A PLACE OF TRANSIT AND HIDING. HOWEVER, SINCE 2015, THE COUNTRY HAS SEEN AN INCREASE IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY LOCALLY. MOREOVER, THE ESCALATING INSURGENCY IN CABO DELGADO, MOZAMBIQUE, LED BY ISLAMIST ORGANISATION AHLU-SUNNAH WA-JAMA (ASWJ) WITH INCREASING LINKS TO ISLAMIC STATE CENTRAL AFRICA PROVINCE (ISCAP), FURTHER RAISES THE THREAT OF TERRORISM IN SOUTH AFRICA BY POTENTIALLY INCITING TERRORIST ACTIVITY LOCALLY AND INCREASING THE REGIONAL FLOW OF MILITANT ACTORS. TO ENSURE THESE SECURITY CHALLENGES CAN BE MET, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT POLICYMAKERS UNDERSTAND THE CHANGING NATURE OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, HOW IT MANIFESTS IN SOUTH AFRICA, THE CURRENT COUNTER-TERRORISM CAPACITY OF THE STATE, AND WHAT REGIONAL STRATEGIES MUST BE STRENGTHENED OR DEVELOPED TO ADDRESS THE TRANSNATIONAL NATURE OF TERRORIST NETWORKS TODAY.
17	IMPLEMENTING CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE (CONSTITUTIONALISM) RESULTS FROM CHINA'S MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS OF HARD EXPLORATION AND BITTER LESSONS. ONLY THROUGH PRACTICING THE RULE OF LAW AND EFFECTIVELY ESTABLISHING CONSTITUTIONALISM CAN THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA ("CPC") ESCAPE FROM THE HISTORICAL CYCLE OF SLIDING INTO DECLINE AFTER ACHIEVING SUCCESS AND FULLY SOLVE THE INSTITUTIONAL PROBLEMS AFFECTING ITS LONG-TERM GOVERNANCE AND CHINA'S LONG-TERM STABILITY AND PROSPERITY. IT IS EXTREMELY ERRONEOUS TO PLACE IMPLEMENTING CONSTITUTIONALISM IN OPPOSITION TO THE LEADERSHIP OF THE PARTY. FAILING TO GOVERN THE COUNTRY IN LINE WITH THE CONSTITUTION WILL NOT ONLY UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW BUT VIOLATE THE PARTY'S FUNDAMENTAL LINE AND POLICIES. WE NEED TO STUDY CONSTITUTIONALISM, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, DEVELOP CONSTITUTIONALISM AND BUILD A CHINESE-STYLE SOCIALIST CONSTITUTIONALISM THAT IS SUPERIOR TO ITS CAPITALIST COUNTERPART.
18	LAWLESS VIOLENCE OFTEN PRECEDED THE RULE OF LAW. BRITISH SOVEREIGNTY DEPENDED ON NON-STATE ACTORS SUCH AS THE EAST INDIA COMPANY, WHOSE LAWLESS ACTS PROVOKED THE DEMAND IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT FOR THE RULE OF LAW. CONTEMPORARY TERRORISM MARKS A TIME WHEN LAWLESS VIOLENCE PROLIFERATES AND TERRITORIAL BOUNDARIES ARE INFRINGED UPON, WHEN STATE LEADERS INVOKE 'NON-STATE ACTORS' AND ARGUE FOR THE NEED TO RESPOND IN KIND. TODAY THE STATE MIMICS THE BEHAVIOR OF PRIVATE PARTIES, JUSTIFYING VIOLENCE AS REVENGE AND PRACTICING TORTURE AS THE JUST DESSERTS OF TERRORISTS. IF ONE INTENTION OF TERRORISM IS TO DRIVE A WEDGE BETWEEN THE LAW AND ITS REPRESENTATION, AND UNSETTLE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VIOLENCE AND VISIBILITY, STATE RESPONSES TO TERRORISM SUCH AS IN MUMBAI CONFIRM THAT PUBLIC SPACES CAN BECOME ZONES OF SUSPENDED LEGALITY.
19	PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT, AS A SCARCE SOCIAL RESOURCE, HAS BEEN TURNED INTO A POLITICAL FORT OR THE POSSIBILITY OF MATERIALIZING THE WHIMSICAL INDIVIDUAL INTEREST OF THE SERVANT REPRESENTING THE EMPLOYER STATE THROUGH EFFIGIES SUCH AS ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION. THE NAME AND AMBIGUOUS MEANING OF THIS POWER MAKE IT VIABLE, FOR CONVENIENCE PURPOSES, TO IGNORE THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE ESSENTIAL MINIMUM PRINCIPLES OF THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP AND THE FUNDAMENTAL LABOR RIGHTS. THE RESISTANT CONNIVANCE TO THE TRANSFORMATIONS REFLECTED BY THE LEGISLATOR AND THE VERY DISTANT STANCES AMONG JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES, ON THE ONE HAND, FEED THE RULE OF LAW ABOVE HIGHER REGULATORY CONTENTS AND, ON THE OTHER, MAKE THE PEOPLE'S POSSIBILITY OF FINDING EFFECTIVE RIGHT PROTECTION SELECTIVE. BOTH POSITIONS ARE HIGHLY DELETERIOUS TO THE NEO-CONSTITUTIONAL MODEL.
20	THIS ARTICLE CHALLENGES THE COMMONLY HELD BELIEF THAT ATIMIA IN ITS EARLIEST GREEK USAGE MEANT EXILE, ARGUING INSTEAD THAT ATIMIA AND OUTLAWRY WERE ALWAYS TWO ENTIRELY DISTINCT, THOUGH NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE, CONCEPTS. IT IS OFTEN CLAIMED THAT ATIMIA ORIGINATED AS A PENALTY OF DEATH OR EXILE, BUT THAT OVER TIME ITS HARSHNESS BECAME MODIFIED SO THAT THOSE WHO SUFFERED UNDER ITS RESTRICTIONS COULD NOT BE KILLED OR ASSAULTED WITH IMPUNITY. A CAREFUL STUDY OF THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW THAT ATIMIA NEVER MEANT OUTLAWRY, AND MOREOVER, ITS ARCHAIC COGNATES DO NOT IMPLY THAT IN EARLY TIMES TO LOSE TIME WAS THE SAME AS LOSING MEMBERSHIP IN A POLITICAL COMMUNITY. RATHER, ATIMAZESTHAI ENTAILED THE LOSS OF SOCIAL HONOUR AND STATUS WHICH WAS AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING VALUE IN THE ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETIES OF ARCHAIC GREECE. ATIMIA IN THE CLASSICAL PERIOD IS SIMILARLY A LOSS OF RIGHTS (TIMAI), AND BECAUSE PENALTIES AND CONDITIONS SUCH AS EXILE AND OUTLAWRY CAN BE EASILY DESCRIBED, IN GREEK, AS INVOLVING THE LOSS OF PREROGATIVES (TIMAI), THEY ARE CONCEPTUALLY FORMS OF ATIMIA. HOWEVER, IN THE LEGAL LANGUAGE OF DEMOCRATIC ATHENS ATIMIA IS AND ALWAYS WAS SOMETHING DISTINCT FROM EXILE, AND THIS LEGAL DISTINCTION WENT BACK TO THE VERY EARLIEST TIMES.
21	INCREASINGLY, THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS PLAYING A GREATER ROLE IN SUPPORTING PEACE BUILDING EFFORTS IN CONFLICT AND POST-CONFLICT AREAS BY PROVIDING CRITICAL EXPERTISE, KNOW-HOW, AND CAPITAL. HOWEVER, REPORTS OF THE CORRUPT PRACTICES OF BOTH GOVERNMENTS AND BUSINESSES HAVE PLAGUED INTERNATIONAL PEACE BUILDING EFFORTS, DEEPENING THE DISTRUST OF STRICKEN COMMUNITIES. BUSINESSES ARE PERCEIVED AS BEING SELFISH AND INDIFFERENT TO THE IMPACT THEIR OPERATIONS MAY HAVE ON THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES. ADDITIONALLY, THE CORRUPTION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAS BEEN CITED AS INTERFERING WITH THE CREATION OF STABILITY IN CONFLICT AREAS. WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK, MULTINATIONAL PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS CAN EXERT TWO FORMS OF INFLUENCE: THEY CAN EITHER EXACERBATE THESE PROBLEMS, OR THEY CAN BECOME PART OF THE SOLUTION. WITHOUT A RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST AMONG LOCAL BUSINESSES, GOVERNMENT, AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR, PEACE BUILDING EFFORTS WILL AT BEST BE MIXED, AND COULD POSSIBLY PERPETUATE VIOLENCE IN FRAGILE STATES. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INTERESTS ARE BETTER SERVED WHEN PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS ARE BASED UPON COLLABORATION AND ASSIST IN ESTABLISHING PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNANCE IN CONFLICT AREAS. THIS IN TURN CAN HELP BUILD TRUST AND REGAIN THE CREDIBILITY OF BOTH SECTORS AMONG LOCAL COMMUNITIES, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL IN MAKING PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS MORE EFFECTIVE.
22	THE PARLIAMENT OF KOSOVO PASSED A CONTROVERSIAL AMNESTY LAW IN JULY 2013 WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE BRUSSELS-LED NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN SERBIA AND KOSOVO. THIS ARTICLE EVALUATES THE LAW USING A FUNCTIONAL FRAMEWORK, THUS EXPLORING POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS WITH REGARD TO LEGALITY, THE RULE OF LAW, SECURITY, THE ECONOMY, AND RECONCILIATION. WE FIND THAT THE AMNESTY LAW ENTAILS SERIOUS PROBLEMS OR RISKS IN EACH ASPECT EXCEPT LEGALITY DUE TO ITS BROAD SCOPE WHICH INCLUDES COMMON AND ECONOMIC CRIMES WHILE PROVIDING POSSIBILITIES FOR ABUSE. MOREOVER, INTERNATIONALS ACTORS INVOLVED IN THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS EXERTED CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE TO ADOPT THE AMNESTY LAW WHICH RAISES QUESTIONS CONCERNING THEIR MOTIVES AND STRATEGY. WE ARGUE THAT THEIR UNCRITICAL ATTITUDE CAN BE EXPLAINED BY A COMBINATION OF FOUR PRINCIPAL FACTORS, INCLUDING A STRONG FOCUS ON THE REALIST EXIGENCIES OF DIPLOMACY, INTERNAL INTERESTS OF THE EUROPEAN EXTERNAL ACTION SERVICE, A NEGLECT OF NON-LEGAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE LAW, AND A GENERAL PRACTICE OF EXCEPTIONAL AND UNACCOUNTABLE POLICY-MAKING IN KOSOVO. A FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT AS OFFERED IN THIS ARTICLE WOULD HAVE PROVIDED A MORE COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS OF THE LAW, INCLUDING THE SERIOUS RISKS IT POSES TO THE FRAGILE POST-CONFLICT SITUATION IN KOSOVO.
23	PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE THE INITIATIVES PROVIDING LEGAL INFORMATION DURING THE COVID-19 EMERGENCY, FOCUSING ON THE FUNDAMENTAL ROLE OF DIGITAL LIBRARIES IN CREATING, MANAGING AND SHARING SERVICES TO SUPPORT AND ENSURE ACCESS TO LEGAL INFORMATION IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH TO HAVE AN OVERALL VIEW OF THE LEGAL INFORMATION ON COVID-19 AVAILABLE ON DIGITAL LIBRARIES DURING THE OUTBREAK, A DESK-RESEARCH ON THE WEB WAS CONDUCTED LOOKING FOR BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SOURCES OF INFORMATION. THE SELECTION OF THE SOURCES WAS BASED ON THE TYPE OF INFORMATION AND SERVICES OFFERED, THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION STRUCTURING, TOGETHER WITH THE DATA UPDATING AND THE TARGET USERS. FINDINGS THE SURVEY PROVIDED A HUGE AND HETEROGENEOUS AMOUNT OF LEGAL INFORMATION RESOURCES ON COVID-19. THE ANALYSIS ON THE SOURCE OF INFORMATION SELECTED SHOWED DIFFERENT KINDS OF APPROACHES ADOPTED BY DIGITAL LIBRARIES IN RELATION TO TYPES OF INFORMATION PROVIDED, INFORMATION CATEGORIZATION, TARGET AUDIENCES, PURPOSES AND SERVICES OFFERED. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS TWO LIMITATIONS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED: LACK OF PREVIOUS STUDIES IN THE DOMAIN AND SIZE OF THE SAMPLES CITED. THE CONDUCTED RESEARCH SHOULD BE SEEN AS THE "BUILDING BLOCK" UPON WHICH FURTHER RESEARCH SHOULD BE BROADENED AND DEEPENED. LIMITED SAMPLES ARE CITED BECAUSE OF A RATIONAL CHOICE; NEVERTHELESS, FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD BE CONDUCTED ALSO ADDRESSING A QUANTITATIVE CHOICE ON IDENTIFYING SOURCES. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THE RESEARCH PROPOSES TO GIVE USERS PRACTICAL GUIDANCE, NAMELY, A FIRST SET OF AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES WHICH GIVES LEGAL INFORMATION ON COVID-19. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS REVIEW PAPER COULD BE SEEN AS A FIRST STUDY ON THE ISSUES RELATED TO ACCESSING AND SHARING LEGAL DATA AT THE TIME OF THE COVID-19; THE RESEARCH COULD BE A STARTING POINT FOR DEVISING A NEW FORM OF COMMUNICATION OF LEGAL INFORMATION IN TIMES OF CRISIS.
24	PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO ILLUSTRATE THE PROBLEM OF IMPUNITY IN COLOMBIA. THE FOCUS IS ON CASES OF MEDICAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR FAILURES IN THE PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES, THROUGH A STUDY THAT WILL BRING TOGETHER SOCIOLOGICAL, LEGAL AND STATISTICAL ASPECTS, AND AT THE SAME TIME IT WILL DISCUSS THE EVOLUTION OF JURISPRUDENCE IN THE FIELD OF HEALTH AS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT AND AS A SERVICE PROVIDED BY THE STATE. METHODOLOGY: THE LEX ARTIS WILL BE ANALYZED FROM THE SCIENTIFIC ASPECT OF THE LAW AND FROM SOME POINTS OF VIEW WITH A SCIENTIFIC, PHILOSOPHICAL OF TECHNIQUE AND ART TENDENCY. AT THE SAME TIME, THESE POINTS OF VIEW WILL BE APPLIED IN CONTRAST TO THE LEGAL ACTIVITY, IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND TO SOME EXTENT THE LEGAL PRACTICE WITH RESPECT TO THE MEDICAL ACTIVITY, WITHIN THE LEGAL REFERENTIAL FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED FOR THE ETHICAL BEHAVIOR OF THE HEALTH PROFESSIONAL. FINDINGS: THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPTS OF INTERFERENCE OR CRITERIA TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE LEGAL ASSESSMENT OF THE MEDICAL CASE, SUCH PROCEDURE WILL BE STUDIED, WHICH SEEKS TO ORGANIZE AND UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE OF LEGAL ACTIVITY IN THE SPECIFIC CASE. CONCLUSIONS: THE DOCTOR-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP AND THE LEGAL PROBLEMS THAT ARISE BETWEEN THEM ARE A CONSEQUENCE OF THE ABSENCE OF CLEAR AND CONCRETE LEGAL REGULATION OF THE ACTIONS THAT DERIVE FROM MEDICAL PRACTICE, IN WHICH THIS IS ONLY A PART OF THE FINANCIAL ACTIVITY OF THE HEALTH SECTOR.
25	THE INCLUSION OF PUBLIC POLICIES IN THE STAGE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION ALLOWS THE SEARCH FOR SOLUTIONS TO SOCIALLY PROBLEMATIC SITUATIONS. THIS TOOL INVOLVES NOT ONLY TECHNICAL AND POLITICAL ACTORS, BUT ALSO SOCIAL ACTORS. THEREFORE, IT REPRESENTS A POSSIBILITY TO ACHIEVE THE SOCIAL WELFARE. HOWEVER, INDICATORS SHOW THAT SOCIAL ISSUES HAVE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCED SINCE 1991, IN SPITE OF THE INCORPORATION OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION. AS A RESULT, THE ADVANCES OF THE POLICIES AIM TO RE-ORGANIZE THE POSSIBILITY TO GUARANTEE THE SOCIAL RIGHTS. THESE ADVANCES ALLOW MECHANISMS SUCH AS TUTELAGE OR JUDICIAL DECISIONS TO REGULATE THAT THE RIGHTS COULD BE PLENTY ENJOYED. BEGINNING WITH AN INTERPRETATIVE EXERCISE, THE LIMITATION OF THE POLICIES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED LIKE A CHALLENGE TO BUILD AND CONFIGURE APPROACHES OF IMPLEMENTATION IN THE COLOMBIAN SITUATION, PROVIDED THAT THESE ARE THE MOMENTS WHICH ALLOW THE CONSECUTION OF THE WELFARE IN THE COUNTRY.
26	BACKGROUND: THE REOPENING OF DOMESTIC CRIMINAL, CIVIL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS FOLLOWING EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS FINDINGS OF A VIOLATION OF THE ECHR IS AN EXTRAORDINARY REMEDY; ITS APPLICATION IS DEBATABLE IN THE CONTRACTING STATES TO THE CONVENTION. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ANALYSE THE AVAILABILITY OF THE REOPENING OF PROCEEDINGS AS A MEANS OF ENSURING RESTITUTIO IN INTEGRUM, I.E., THE RESTORATION OF THE STATUS QUO ANTE FOR A VICTIM OF VIOLATION OR AWARDING COMPENSATION THAT WOULD BE SUFFICIENT IN ORDER BRING THE VICTIM OF A VIOLATION BACK TO THEIR POSITION AS IF NO VIOLATION HAD BEEN COMMITTED. METHODS: THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE EXAMINATION OF WHETHER REOPENING A CASE FOLLOWING AN ADVERSARIAL ECTHR JUDGMENT IS AVAILABLE AS A REMEDY IN THE NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT EUROPE. THE METHOD IS COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITHOUT CLAIMING TO BE EXHAUSTIVE. WHERE ANALYSED DATA MADE IT POSSIBLE, CERTAIN GENERALISATIONS WERE MADE. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: THE RESEARCH ALLOWED US TO CONCLUDE THAT IN CONTRAST TO THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COE CM RECOMMENDATION, IN PART RELATED TO MAKING AVAILABLE REOPENING IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS TO THE BENEFIT OF A VICTIM OF A VIOLATION OF THE ECHR IN ALMOST EVERY MEMBER STATE, THE REOPENING OF CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS REMAINS AVAILABLE ONLY IN HALF OF THE MEMBER STATES, WHERE IT FACES SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS AIMED AT PROTECTING RES JUDICATA AND INTERESTS OF GOOD FAITH THIRD PARTIES (THE BONA FIDE THIRD PARTIES). ALSO, IT HAS BECOME SUBJECT TO A TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS AS A LEGAL REMEDY COMPARED TO COMPENSATION MEASURES.
27	SOUTH AFRICAN LEGAL HISTORY IS "MODERN": THE DUTCH BROUGHT THE 17TH-CENTURY EUROPEAN RENAISSANCE TO SOUTHERN AFRICA. NORTH-ATLANTIC CULTURAL ARROGANCE AND THE RATIONALISATION OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC IMMORALITY WERE AN INTEGRAL PART OF WESTERN LIBERALISM EVEN UP TO WORLD WAR II. WHEN SOUTH AFRICA ACHIEVED STATEHOOD IN 1910, IT WAS FOUNDED UPON THE 19TH-CENTURY COLONIAL ETHOS. IN 1948 THE DUAL DREAM OF THE AFRIKANERS (LIBERATION FROM THE BRITISH YOKE AND SECURING THEIR SURVIVAL AS A MINORITY) BLINDED THEM FROM RECOGNISING THE GLOBAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE AMERICAN-SPONSORED LIBERAL HUMANISM, LEADING TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE UNITED NATIONS (UN) AND THE INSTITUTIONALISATION OF THE NOTION OF UNIVERSAL HUMAN RIGHTS. FOLLOWING THE END OF WWII, NUMEROUS FORMER COLONIES AND DEPENDENCIES OBTAINED THEIR INDEPENDENCE FROM EUROPEAN STATES AND THE USSR, QUADRUPLING THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE UN WITHIN A FEW DECADES. BY THE 1990S, LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONALISM HAD CRYSTALLISED AS A RANGE OF INTERRELATED ELEMENTS, ESTABLISHING THE NORM FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE AND ECONOMIC SUCCESS UNDER NORTH-ATLANTIC HEGEMONY (SEE TABLE 1). WHEN STATE PRESIDENT FW DE KLERK ANNOUNCED THE RADICAL HISTORICAL TURNING POINT IN THE HISTORY OF SOUTH AFRICA ON 2 FEBRUARY 1990, THE QUESTION WAS WHAT WOULD BE "JUST, RIGHT AND FAIR" IN A HUGELY COMPLICATED SITUATION. ALTHOUGH SOME CONSTITUTIONALIST ELEMENTS HAD AT THE TIME BEEN PRESENT IN SOUTH AFRICAN LAW, A LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC CULTURE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND CONSTITUTIONALISM DID NOT EXIST. NEVERTHELESS, TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED CHANGE, THE ANC, AS THE ONLY ORGANISATION CAPABLE OF MOBILISING A POLITICAL MAJORITY, WAS AN UNAVOIDABLE COMPONENT OF THE POLITICAL EQUATION, DESPITE HAVING JUST EMERGED FROM AT LEAST THREE DECADES OF MARXIST/ LENINIST INDOCTRINATION AS A CLIENT OF THE COLLAPSED USSR. WHAT HAD TO BE CLEAR FOR ALL TO SEE, WAS THAT COMPROMISES HAD TO BE MADE, WHICH COULD NEITHER INCLUDE CONTINUED RACIAL SEPARATION NOR TAKE THE FORM OF A SOCIALIST REVOLUTION. CONSTITUTIONALLY, THE MOST ATTRACTIVE AVAILABLE MODEL ON WHICH THE POLITICAL COMPROMISES COULD BE BUILT, WAS LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM AS IT WAS EXEMPLIFIED IN PARTICULAR IN THE POST-WAR CONSTITUTIONS OF GERMANY AND CANADA. IRONICALLY, NOW, THREE DECADES LATER, IT IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM HAS GLOBALLY ENTERED A CRISIS PHASE, UNABLE TO COUNTER POPULISM, EXTREMIST POLITICS, DIGITAL UBIQUITY OR THE INHUMANE CONDUCT OF STATES SUCH AS CHINA, RUSSIA AND VARIOUS MIDDLE-EASTERN COUNTRIES. THE REASONS FOR THE CRISIS ARE COMPLEX, BUT IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THEY INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: THE FOUNDATIONAL THINKING UNDERPINNING LIBERAL DEMOCRACY IS STEADILY LOSING ITS COGENCY; THIS LOSS OF PERSUASIVENESS IS FORTIFIED BY FACTORS SUCH AS EXPONENTIAL POPULATION GROWTH AND GLOBALISATION; AND THE LACK OF COGENCY OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY, SUCH AS THE FICTIONAL SOCIAL CONTRACT, THE NATION STATE AND NATURAL LAW. LIBERALISM AS CIVIL RELIGION, BASED ON SELF-SUFFICIENT INDIVIDUALISM, HAS BECOME IMPOTENT IN THE FACE OF THE CHALLENGES FACED BY HUMANITY IN THE 21ST CENTURY. WHEN THE ANC GOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE ITS PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY TO STEER THE WRITING OF THE "FINAL" CONSTITUTION IN 1995/96, IT SUPERIMPOSED PARTICULAR ELEMENTS OF SOCIALISM ON THE CONSTITUTIONALISM OF THE 1993 CONSTITUTION, INCLUDING CENTRALISED PRESIDENTIAL POWERS, THE QUALIFICATION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS, EGALITARIAN STANDARDS OF JUSTICE AND THE JUSTIFICATION OF SELECTIVE DISCRIMINATION IN, FOR EXAMPLE, LABOUR RELATIONS AND STATE PROCUREMENT. THESE WERE THE FIRST STEPS INDICATIVE OF MERE PRAGMATISM ON THE PART OF THE ANC WHEN IT ACCEDED IN 1993 TO SUPPORT THE INTRODUCTION OF CONSTITUTIONALISM. SUBSEQUENTLY, ON THE LEVEL OF SOCIAL INDOCTRINATION, THE ELASTIC NOTION OF "TRANSFORMATION" WAS CANONISED WITH THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF PROMOTING THE INTERESTS OF THE "PROLETARIAN" (BLACK) MASSES AS POLICY IMPERATIVE TO TURN COLONIAL HISTORY AGAINST THE (WHITE) "BOURGEOISIE". SUPPORTED BY PARLIAMENTARY LEGISLATION ADOPTED SINCE 1998, PATENTLY SOCIALIST POLICIES HAVE SYSTEMATICALLY BEEN INTRODUCED, INCLUDING THE "TRANSFORMATIONAL" REGULATION OF LABOUR, (UNCONSTITUTIONAL) "CADRE DEPLOYMENT" AT ALL LEVELS OF STATE EMPLOYMENT, THE VIRTUAL NATIONALISATION OF WATER RIGHTS, MINERAL RIGHTS AND MARINE RESOURCES, ENFORCED ANNEXATION OF PRIVATE BUSINESS INTERESTS BY MEANS OF "BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT", STATE CONTROL OVER THE LEGAL PROFESSIONS AND HIGHER EDUCATION, THE GROWING DEPENDENCY OF AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF THE POPULATION ON STATE SOCIAL GRANTS, THE ONGOING PREPARATIONS FOR THE NATIONALISATION OF THE HEALTH SECTOR AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL EMPOWERMENT OF EXPROPRIATION WITHOUT COMPENSATION. DESPITE THESE INDICATORS, THE ANC, PROBABLY UNDER THE INTELLECTUAL GUIDANCE OF THE INTELLIGENTSIA CONCENTRATED IN ITS ALLIANCE PARTNER, THE SACP, STRATEGICALLY DOES NOT OPENLY CHARACTERISE ITS POLICIES AS "SOCIALIST", BUT EVEN IN ITS THIRD DECADE IN GOVERNMENT, ILLOGICALLY MAINTAINS THAT IT STILL IS A REVOLUTIONARY LIBERATION MOVEMENT. THERE ARE NO OBVIOUS SOLUTIONS TO THE WORLDWIDE CRISIS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM. THE ILLIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM OF FOR EXAMPLE, CHINA - A VIRTUAL DICTATORSHIP WITH A POPULATION APPARENTLY UNPERTURBED BY COMPREHENSIVE STATE INCURSIONS ON INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY IN EXCHANGE FOR PERSONAL WEALTH MAY BE PERCEIVED BY SOME TO BE A SOLUTION. SUCH A SYSTEM, HOWEVER, STANDS IN COMPLETE CONTRADICTION TO WESTERN NOTIONS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM. A RESPONSE TO WHAT WOULD BE CONSTITUTIONALLY JUST AND FAIR FROM A CHRISTIAN PERSPECTIVE REQUIRES RECOGNITION THAT REAL JUSTICE IS NOT MAN-MADE, BUT A DIVINE GIFT. IN THE HANDS OF HUMANITY, OPTIMAL CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE MAY BE PURSUED NOT ON LIBERAL, RATIONALISTIC OR SOCIALIST FOUNDATIONS, BUT BASED ON RECIPROCITY, WHICH IS THE TIME-HONOURED INTUITIVE GOLDEN RULE PREDATING JESUS PROPOUNDING THEREOF AS DOING UNTO OTHERS AS YOU WOULD WISH THEM TO DO UNTO YOU. IN THE END, ONE MAY FIND SOLACE IN THE TRUTH THAT HISTORY IS NOT DEPENDENT ON THE SEVEN OR EIGHT BILLION PRESUMABLY AUTONOMOUS DENIZENS OF EARTH HOLDING WIDELY DIVERGENT WORLD VIEWS, BUT IS EXCLUSIVELY IN THE HANDS OF THE SOVEREIGN CREATOR.
28	IN THEIR 2018 ARTICLE, DIEHL AND DRUCKMAN ADDRESS SEVERAL HURDLES THAT MAY HINDER THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MULTIPLE MISSION PEACE OPERATIONS. ONE OF THESE HURDLES IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH TWO OR MORE MISSIONS ARE COMPATIBLE. BASED ON THE IDEA THAT SIMILAR MISSIONS HAVE POSITIVELY REINFORCING EFFECTS, WE PROPOSE ALTERNATIVE INDICATORS OF THE COMPATIBILITY CONCEPT IN THE CONTEXT OF NINE TYPES OF UN MISSIONS CONDUCTED WITHIN THE SAME PEACE OPERATION. WE CODE ALL MISSIONS IN EACH OF 70 UN PEACE OPERATIONS (1948-2016) ON TWELVE CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS WHETHER THE MISSION COULD BE CONSIDERED IMPARTIAL OR BIASED, WHETHER IT ALLOWS FOR AN EASY OR HARD EXIT, AND COORDINATION WITH IOS OR THE HOST GOVERNMENT. A MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED TO EVALUATE THE PROXIMITY OF THESE MISSIONS: MISSIONS CLOSER IN PROXIMITY ARE REGARDED AS BEING MORE COMPATIBLE THAN THOSE FARTHER AWAY. THE PROXIMITY SCORES ARE USED TO DEVELOP THE THREE COMPATIBILITY INDICATORS BASED ON DIFFERENT THEORETICAL LOGICS. WE THEN APPLY THESE INDICATORS IN SOME PRELIMINARY STATISTICAL ANALYSES AND ALSO COMPARE TWO PEACE OPERATIONS WITH DIFFERENT COMPATIBILITY CHARACTERISTICS TO ILLUSTRATE ON-THE-GROUND RELEVANCE OF THE INDICATORS. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES CONCERNING VALIDITY, NEXT STEPS IN THE RESEARCH, AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED.
29	THE CRISIS OVER APPOINTMENTS TO THE WTO'S APPELLATE BODY HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING CONFLICTS THE GATT/WTO SYSTEM HAS EVER SEEN, THREATENING TO DESTROY A CORE INSTITUTION OF THE WORLD TRADING SYSTEM. THE APPELLATE BODY HAS PLAYED A VALUABLE ROLE IN DISPUTE SETTLEMENT, BY PROVIDING A COHERENT SET OF JURISPRUDENCE TO GUIDE WTO MEMBERS AS TO THE MEANING OF WTO LAW. THE APPELLATE BODY DOES NOT CREATE FORMAL PRECEDENT, BUT NEVERTHELESS ITS REASONING IN PAST CASES SERVES INFORMALLY TO CREATE EXPECTATIONS AS TO THE MEANING OF THE WTO AGREEMENTS. THE UNITED STATES HAS OBJECTED TO THE APPELLATE BODY'S TREATMENT OF PAST RULINGS, ARGUING THAT THE APPELLATE BODY HAS ELEVATED THESE RULINGS TO BINDING PRECEDENT . HOWEVER, A CAREFUL READING OF THE LANGUAGE USED BY THE APPELLATE BODY TO DESCRIBE ITS VIEWS INDICATES THAT THE APPELLATE BODY HAS NOT DONE SO. THE US OBJECTIONS ARE ONE PART OF ITS SERIES OF CONCERNS JUSTIFYING ITS BLOCKING OF APPOINTMENTS. LOSING THE APPELLATE BODY OVER THIS DISPUTE WOULD BE DEVASTATING TO THE WTO, AND ENGAGEMENT ON THESE ISSUES MUST CONTINUE IN GOOD FAITH IN ORDER TO FIND A RESOLUTION.
30	THE INTRODUCTION OF A UNIFIED JUDICIAL EXAMINATION MARKED AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD LEGAL PROFESSIONALIZATION IN CHINA. FOLLOWING A CONSERVATIVE TURN IN JUDICIAL REFORMS BETWEEN 2007 AND 2012, POLITICAL CONTENT WAS INCLUDED IN THE EXAM. ON THE BASIS OF EXAM TEXTS, MODEL ANSWERS, AND LEGAL AND OTHER DOCUMENTS, THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE CONTENT OF POLITICAL QUESTIONS ON THE JUDICIAL EXAM. THE ANALYSIS OF EXAM QUESTIONS REVEALS THE PARTY-STATE'S PERCEPTION OF THE LAW-POLITICS NEXUS AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE POLITICAL CONTENT OF THE EXAM FOR ASPIRING LEGAL PROFESSIONALS. CANDIDATES LEARN THAT THEY HAVE TO GRASP THE CURRENT PARTY IDEOLOGY IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER THE CORRECT INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW FOR SERVING THE OVERALL POLITICAL SITUATION. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE EXAMINATION QUESTIONS IMPLY THAT POLITICAL GUIDELINES SERVE AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR FINE-TUNING THE APPLICATION OF LAW ACCORDING TO NEW POLICY AIMS AS WELL AS SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGE.
31	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE CHALLENGES THAT CHINA'S HEALTH CODE SYSTEM PRESENTS TO INDIVIDUALS' LIVES AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, USING NORMATIVE ANALYSIS AND A CASE STUDY. IT LOOKS FOR EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES TO REFORM AND REGULATE THIS SYSTEM TO PREPARE FOR FUTURE PANDEMICS. HEALTH CODE APPS AND MINI PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN WIDELY DEPLOYED AS EFFECTIVE TOOLS FOR COVID-19 CONTAINMENT IN CHINA. HOWEVER, THEIR WIDESPREAD AND IMPROPER USE HAS CREATED RISKS DUE TO THE LACK OF BOTH A SYSTEMATIC DESIGN AND A BASIC SUPERVISION MECHANISM. THE HEALTH CODE SYSTEM RISKS INFRINGING ON INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY DURING DATA COLLECTION AND STORAGE. DURING THE PANDEMIC, THE RIGHT TO LIBERTY AND THE RIGHT TO TREATMENT OF CHINESE CITIZENS WHO LACKED AN APPROPRIATE HEALTH CODE WERE SEVERELY COMPROMISED. IN SOME INSTANCES, THE HEALTH CODE SYSTEM WAS USED AS A STABILITY MAINTENANCE TOOL BY THE AUTHORITIES THROUGH ARBITRARY HEALTH CODE CONVERSIONS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT CHINA'S HEALTH CODE SYSTEMS SHOULD BE REFORMED AND REGULATED IN PREPARATION FOR FUTURE PANDEMICS AND THAT A NEW ACT REGULATING ITS MANAGEMENT AND USE SHOULD BE LAUNCHED AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. DATA COLLECTION, RETENTION, AND PROCESSING SHOULD BE LIMITED TO THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF DATA NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE OF PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH. THE HEALTH CODE CONVERSION POWER WIELDED BY THE AUTHORITIES SHOULD BE DEFINED AND REGULATED, THE RULES AND PROCEDURES OF CODE CONVERSION SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT, ARBITRARY HEALTH CODE CONVERSION BEHAVIORS SHOULD BE PREVENTED AND PUNISHED, AND PERSONS WHOSE RIGHTS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED BY WRONGFUL CODE CONVERSION SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO LEGAL REMEDIES.
32	THIS STUDY EXAMINED WHETHER MERITOCRACY IN THE CIVIL SERVICE (MERIT-BASED HIRING AND ADMINISTRATIVE IMPARTIALITY) CAN PRODUCE DESIRABLE OUTCOMES, SPECIFICALLY RECRUITING AND RETAINING HIGHLY COMPETENT PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. USING DATA FROM THE 2015 QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT EXPERT SURVEY II, WHICH POLLED 886 PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION EXPERTS FROM 149 COUNTRIES, THIS STUDY FOUND THAT, OVERALL, MERIT-BASED PRACTICES IN GOVERNMENT CAN ENHANCE THE CAPACITY OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES TO PROMOTE THE EFFICIENCY OF PUBLIC SERVICES, STRIVE TO HELP CITIZENS, OBEY THE LAWS, ACTIVELY IMPLEMENT PUBLIC POLICY, AND UPHOLD INTEGRITY. HOWEVER, TESTING THE HYPOTHESIZED MODEL WITH SUB-SAMPLES FROM SEVEN GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS/GROUPS (AFRICA, ASIA, LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN, NORTH AMERICA, OCEANIA, EUROPEAN UNION (EU) COUNTRIES, AND NON-EU COUNTRIES) REVEALED VARYING RELATIONSHIPS. SPECIFICALLY, IN NORTH AMERICA AND OCEANIA, MERITOCRACY WAS NOT STATISTICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH SUPPLYING BUREAUCRATS WHO CONCERN FOR EFFICIENCY. IN NORTH AMERICA, MERITOCRACY WAS NOT STATISTICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH SUPPLYING BUREAUCRATS WHO STRIVE TO HELP CITIZENS AND OBEY THE LAWS. INTERESTINGLY, THE POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MERITOCRACY AND ENLISTING BUREAUCRATS WITH AN ACTIVE WILLINGNESS TO IMPLEMENT POLICY LAID DOWN BY POLITICIANS CAN ONLY BE FOUND IN EU COUNTRIES. FINALLY, IN NORTH AMERICA AND OCEANIA, MERITOCRACY WAS NOT STATISTICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH ENHANCING INTEGRITY IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION.
33	I EXPLORE THE CONCEPT OF MILITANT DEMOCRACY IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT APPEAR TO BE PERSISTENT THREATS TO THE DEMOCRATIC ORDER. I BEGIN WITH A RECONSTRUCTION OF THE CONCEPT WITH THE INTENTION OF DISTINGUISHING AND IDENTIFYING ITS HISTORICAL MANIFESTATIONS. I TRACE AND DOCUMENT TWO CONSTITUTIONAL DEVICES THAT EXHIBIT THE PRE-EMPTION AND ILLIBERALISM THAT CHARACTERIZES MILITANT DEMOCRACY. THE FIRST DEVICE-PARTY RESTRICTIONS-IS THE PROTOTYPICAL EXAMPLE OF THE CONCEPT AND IS DESIGNED TO PRE-EMPT EXTREMIST INTIMIDATION. THE SECOND EXAMPLE-HARDENED TERM LIMITS-IS DESIGNED TO PRE-EMPT EXECUTIVE AMBITION. THE LATTER FORM OF BULLYING MAY BE THE MOST RELEVANT THREAT, AT LEAST IN MODERN LATIN AMERICA AND AFRICA. IN ONE VIEW, TERM-LIMIT EVASION ACCELERATES A PERNICIOUS NEGATIVE CYCLE IN WHICH CONSTITUTIONAL NON-COMPLIANCE BEGETS CONSTITUTIONAL WEAKNESS, WHICH IN TURN BEGETS SUBSEQUENT NON-COMPLIANCE. SUCH A NEGATIVE FEEDBACK LOOP IS A CORE PROBLEM IN LAW. MILITANT DEMOCRACY, THE LOGIC OF WHICH IMPLIES THE ENTRENCHMENT AND PROTECTION OF TERM LIMITS, COULD POTENTIALLY DISRUPT SUCH NEGATIVE CYCLES. THE CONCEPT COULD ALSO BE USEFUL AS AN INTELLECTUAL DEFENSE OF SEEMINGLY NON-DEMOCRATIC MEANS OF PROTECTING DEMOCRACY.
34	THE VIETNAMESE PARTY-STATE HAS BEEN SEEKING TO DEVELOP THE CONCEPT OF A SOCIALIST LAW-BASED STATE IN AN EFFORT TO PROVIDE A LEGAL-RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION FOR ITS RULE. ONE OF THE KEY PILLARS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SOCIALIST LAW-BASED STATE HAS BEEN ELECTORAL GOVERNANCE. UNLIKE THE POPULAR UNDERSTANDING PROLIFERATED BY THE WESTERN MEDIA ABOUT THE MEANING OF ELECTIONS IN AUTHORITARIAN COUNTRIES, I ARGUE THAT ELECTIONS ARE OF SIGNIFICANCE TO THE POLITICAL LIFE OF THE VIETNAMESE PARTY-STATE EVEN WITHOUT PRESSURE FROM ANY POLITICAL OPPOSITION. THIS IS BECAUSE THERE IS A GROWING NEED FOR THE PARTY-STATE TO MAKE THE ELECTIONS WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY TO BOLSTER ITS LEGITIMACY. ALONG WITH THE PROCESS OF PROMOTING THE CONCEPT OF A VIETNAMESE SOCIALIST LAW-BASED STATE, CONTINUOUS REFORMS OF THE ELECTORAL INTEGRITY SYSTEM HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AND CAUTIOUSLY IMPLEMENTED. AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE REFORM IS TO ENSURE THE VALUES, PURPOSES AND DUTIES FOR WHICH POWER IS ENTRUSTED TO OR HELD BY ELECTORAL INSTITUTIONS ARE HONOURED. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE PROCESS OF BUILDING A MORE INTEGRATED NATIONAL SYSTEM OF RULES AND VALUES HAS BEEN SET IN MOTION BUT MANY SETBACKS HAVE OCCURRED FROM TIME TO TIME, MAKING IT A DYNAMIC PROCESS.
35	UNIVERSITY PHASE IS A MAJOR TURNING POINT IN YOUTH'S LIFE AND THIS IS A TIME OF PROFOUND MENTAL AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT OF STUDENTS. WITHOUT PROPER DIRECTION AND GUIDANCE, IT IS COMMON FOR STUDENTS TO DEVELOP DEVIANT BEHAVIORS, NON-LAW ABIDANCE AND UNHEALTHY BELIEFS. IN THIS REGARD, AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS IS THE IMPARTING OF MORAL VALUES AND LAW-ABIDING BEHAVIORS IN STUDENTS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE THE ROLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM IN FOSTERING LAW-ABIDING BEHAVIOR AMONG CHINESE STUDENTS, AS WELL AS THE ISSUES IT CAUSES FOR SOCIETY. FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE PRINCIPLES OF LAW-ABIDING BEHAVIOR WERE STUDIED AND KEY PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS USED IN THE SYSTEM WERE IDENTIFIED. THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE BIBLIOMETRIC RESEARCH ARE DESIGNED TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND THE METHOD FOR PREVENTING STUDENT MISBEHAVIOR IN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, HENCE ENHANCING THE EFFICACY OF PREVENTATIVE WORK WITH STUDENTS. THEY MAY SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR THE CREATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF PROGRAMS AND STRATEGIES AIMED AT TEACHING LAWFUL BEHAVIOR AMONG STUDENTS. MORE THAN 3,785 ARTICLES WERE PUBLISHED RELATED LAW-ABIDING BEHAVIOR FROM 2000 TO THE END OF JULY 2022 YEARS WERE EXAMINED IN THIS RESEARCH USING THE SCOPUS DATABASE AND THE ORIGINAL SAMPLE WAS NARROWED DOWN TO INCLUDE ONLY ARTICLES, BOOK CHAPTER AND CONFERENCE PAPERS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO LAW-ABIDING BEHAVIOR AND HIGHER EDUCATION LITERATURE. THE VOS VIEWER SOFTWARE WAS USED TO EXECUTE THE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND SCIENTIFIC MAPPING APPROACHES USING CO-CITATION ANALYSIS. IN THE DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS, WE ANALYZED PUBLISHING PATTERNS OVER TIME, THE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCALIZATION OF THE CONTRIBUTING INSTITUTIONS, JOURNALS, THE MOST PROLIFIC AUTHORS. THE FINDINGS OF THE PRESENT STUDY MAY ALSO PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION FOR A PLANNED EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVE WHOSE ULTIMATE AIM IS TO PRODUCE A FULLY REALIZED, HARMONIOUS, SELF-RELIANT, MATURE, AND LAW-ABIDING PERSON. THE STUDY HAS PROVIDED SUPPORTING EVIDENCE FOR HOW YOUNGSTERS LEGAL SENSIBILITIES ARE SHAPED IN UNIVERSITIES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED. TWO DISTINCT BUT INTERDEPENDENT EDUCATIONAL SPHERES, THE NORMATIVE LEGAL SPHERE AND THE SPACE FOR THE CREATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF STUDENTS' PERSONALITIES MUST WORK TOGETHER TO RAISE AND EDUCATE YOUNGSTERS.
36	AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK ONBOARD THE CRUISE SHIP DIAMOND PRINCESS, BOTH THE FLAG STATE AND THE PORT STATE SHOULD ACT ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS DURING THE SAILING STAGE, QUARANTINE PERIOD AFTER SHIPS' BERTHING, AND THE TIME WHEN THE QUARANTINE PERIOD EXPIRES. HOWEVER, THE POTENTIAL DANGER OF THE ABSENCE OF A "GENUINE LINK " BETWEEN THE CRUISE SHIPOWNERS AND THE FLAG STATE, THE LACK OF COORDINATION OF JURISDICTION IN DIFFERENT SEA AREAS AND BETWEEN DIFFERENT STATES, AND ALSO THE LACK OF SPECIAL OR SYSTEMATIC REGULATIONS FOR INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL (IPC) AT SEA AND FOR CRUISE SHIPS INCREASE THE RISK OF A STATE'S BREACH OF INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS. THEREFORE, IT IS DEEMED NECESSARY TO IMPROVE THE RESPONSIVE MEASURES IN INTERNATIONAL LAW. THIS PAPER, AFTER REVIEW AND ANALYSIS, SHEDS LIGHT ON VARIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO IMPROVE THE RESPONSIVE MEASURES IN INTERNATIONAL LAW, INCLUDING (I) STRENGTHENING OF THE JURISDICTION OF THE FLAG STATE, (II) ESTABLISHMENT OF A SPECIAL INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION MECHANISM WITH AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE WHO AND THE IMO, AND (III) CONSTRUCTION OF AN IPC MECHANISM FOR HOME PORTS OF CRUISE SHIPS.
37	NIETZSCHE DID NOT MISS ANY OPPORTUNITY TO DISPARAGE MILL AS A TYPICAL PASSIVE-MINDED ENGLISHMAN, AN ASPECT THAT INSTEAD MAKES CURRENT INTERPRETERS OF NIETZSCHE CAUTIOUS, SINCE THE GERMAN PHILOSOPHER READ MILL VERY CAREFULLY, IN PARTICULAR HIS ON LIBERTY. WHEN HE ENCOURAGES ZARATHUSTRA TO SPEAK ABOUT "THE COLDEST OF ALL COLD MONSTERS", HE DOES SO NOT WITHOUT A PROMISE OF THE FUTURE: "THERE, WHERE THE STATE ENDS, THERE BEGINS THE HUMAN BEING WHO IS NOT SUPERFLUOUS [...]. THERE, WHERE THE STATE ENDS, - LOOK AT ME IN THIS WAY, MY BROTHERS! DO YOU NOT SEE HIM, THE RAINBOW AND THE BRIDGES OF THE SUPERHUMAN?" THIS PAPER ESTABLISHES A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE VISION OF GOD AND THE STATE IN MODERN TIMES, AND THE REFLECTION THAT FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE MAKES IN THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA ABOUT THE STATE AS SOMETHING MONSTROUS (UNGEHEUER). FOR THIS PURPOSE, PASSAGES FROM THE WORKS OF GEORG WILHELM FRIEDRICH HEGEL, ARTHUR SCHONPENHAUER, FRIEDRICH LEOPOLD STOLBERG, KARL MARX, MAX STERNER, WILHELM VON HUMBOLDT AND JOHN STUART MILL WILL EACH BE DISCUSSED.
38	PURPOSE: LABOR STABILITY IS INTENDED TO GIVE A PERMANENT CHARACTER TO THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP, IN WHICH THE WORKER CAN VOLUNTARILY DECIDE WHETHER TO CONTINUE IN THE JOB; AND ONLY IN EXCEPTIONAL CASES, THE EMPLOYER CAN RESOLVE THE RELATIONSHIP. IN COLOMBIA, THERE IS RELATIVE STABILITY; ONLY IN SPECIAL CASES THERE IS ABSOLUTE STABILITY, IN WHICH THE RIGHT TO WORK IS EVEN STRONGER, SO THAT IN SUCH EVENTS WE CAN SPEAK OF A FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO REINFORCED LABOR STABILITY. METHODOLOGY: THE ARTICLE IS BASED ON THE STUDY OF CONSTITUTIONAL SENTENCES, IN ORDER TO SHOW HOW THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HAS ESTABLISHED THE RULES OF THE FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO REINFORCED LABOR STABILITY, AND THE SCOPE OF ITS PROTECTION THROUGH PROTECTIVE ACTION SENTENCES, STARTING WITH SENTENCE C-470 OF 1997, WITH A PAPER BY DR. ALEJANDRO MARTINEZ CABALLERO. THE DOCTRINE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IS CONSTRUCTED THROUGH PROTECTIVE ACTION SENTENCES (TYPE T SENTENCES), CONSTITUTIONALITY SENTENCES (TYPE C SENTENCES) AND UNIFICATION SENTENCES (TYPE SU SENTENCES). FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HAS CONSIDERED THAT THERE ARE SOME CASES IN WHICH THE RIGHT TO LABOR STABILITY, ENSHRINED IN ARTICLE 53 OF THE POLITICAL CONSTITUTION, DESERVES GREATER PROTECTION.
39	THE POST-JUNE WAR PERIOD BECOMES PREDOMINANTLY, THOUGH NOT EXCLUSIVELY, AN 'ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN' CONFLICT RATHER THAN AN 'ARAB-ISRAELI' CONFLICT. WHAT SORT OF STATE IS THE PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANISATION (PLO) WISHING TO ESTABLISH? SINCE AT LEAST 1968, THE PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP HAS MADE EXPLICIT STATEMENTS CONCERNING GOVERNANCE, ESPECIALLY IN FAVOUR OF DEMOCRACY AND JUSTICE. WHY WAS THIS IGNORED? THE FIRST AIM OF THIS STUDY IS NOT TO DRAW OUT THE SITUATED NUANCES AND CONTOURS FOR A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE PALESTINIAN PERCEPTION OF GOVERNANCE AND INTERNATIONAL LAW, RATHER THE AIM IS THEMATICALLY TO EXAMINE THE PALESTINIAN SUPPORT FOR A MORE DEMOCRATIC FORM OF GOVERNANCE. SECONDLY, THIS STUDY ATTEMPTS TO EXAMINE THE OFFICIAL ISRAELI RECORD AND REACTION (OR LACK THEREOF) TO THESE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE PALESTINIANS. FINALLY, THESE FINDINGS WILL BE COMPARED TO CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND DEMOCRATISATION. THE STUDY ENDS WITH A QUESTION TO THE READER: WHAT IF MORE ENERGY WERE PLACED INTO SUPPORTING DEMOCRACY RATHER THAN MANAGING CONFLICT? OR, SAID ANOTHER WAY, JUSTICE RATHER THAN PEACE?
40	NO COUNTRY IS AN EXCEPTION WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF CORRUPTION, BUT THE SEVERITY AND STRUCTURE OF THIS PHENOMENON DIFFER FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER. THIS RESEARCH INVESTIGATED CONTEXT-SPECIFIC RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE SOCIO-POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT AND CORRUPTION IN NIGERIA. THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE, I. E., SOCIO-POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IS PROXIED BY THE FOLLOWING GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVE-NESS INDICES, SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND POLITICAL RIGHTS. THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE, I. E., CORRUPTION IS PROXIED BY THE CORRUPTION PERCEPTION INDEX. THE STUDY COVERS THE PERIOD FROM 1999 TO 2019 USING AUTO-REGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAGS (ARDL) FOR THE ANALYSIS OF THE DATA AND SOME DIAGNOSTIC TESTS, SUCH AS SERIAL CORRELATION, HETEROSCEDASTICITY TEST, AND NORMALITY TEST, WHICH WERE CARRIED OUT TO TEST THE FINDINGS. THE RESULT REVEALED THAT ONLY POLITICAL STABILITY SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCES CORRUPTION IN NIGERIA, UNDERSCORING THE IMPORTANCE OF UNINTERRUPTED DEMOCRACY SINCE 1999 IN CORRUPTION PERCEPTION OF THE COUNTRY. CONTRARILY, THE GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, THE RULE OF LAW, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, AND THE POLITICAL RIGHT INDICES FAILED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON CORRUPTION PERCEPTION AND CONTROL IN NIGERIA. THIS IMPLIES THAT, WITH THE CURRENT SOCIO-POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN NIGERIA, CORRUPTION CASES IN THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN ON THE RISE. HENCE, NIGERIA'S SOCIO-POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IS TOO WEAK TO HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CORRUPTION CONTROL. THE STUDY RECOMMENDS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD BE FOLLOWED EFFECTIVELY SO THAT CORRUPTION CAN BE CURTAILED IN NIGERIA.
41	THIS STUDY AIMS TO (I) UNDERSTAND HOW THE LEGACIES OF THE 1994 GENOCIDE AGAINST THE TUTSI AND ITS AFTERMATH ARE TRANSMITTED TO THE NEXT GENERATION WITHIN RWANDAN FAMILIES AND (II) EXPLORE HOW INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT PLAYS A ROLE IN THE PATHWAYS OF INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION. THROUGH AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH 41 MOTHERS AND ONE OF THEIR ADOLESCENT CHILDREN, WE IDENTIFIED DIRECT AND INDIRECT PATHWAYS THROUGH WHICH THE LEGACIES OF THE GENOCIDE ARE TRANSMITTED TO THE SECOND GENERATION. DIRECT PATHWAYS CONCERN THE WAYS IN WHICH THE GENOCIDE AND ITS AFTERMATH ARE REFLECTED UPON, RECONSTRUCTED AND EXPLICITLY COMMUNICATED OR SILENCED TO THE SECOND GENERATION. INDIRECT PATHWAYS ARE WAYS IN WHICH THE GENOCIDE AND ITS AFTERMATH AFFECT THE LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CHILDREN, AND THROUGH THAT, THE CHILD. MANY OF THE INCLUDED HOUSEHOLDS HAD ACCESS TO AT LEAST SOME KIND OF SUPPORT. IN GENERAL, OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT ORGANISATIONS PROVIDING SUPPORT TO FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS IN POST-CONFLICT SETTINGS MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER FOCUSING EXPLICITLY ON THE IDENTIFIED PATHWAYS OF INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION TO IMPROVE THE LIVING CONDITIONS OF THE NEXT GENERATION(S).
42	AS THE DOCTRINE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW HAS MATURED, CANADIAN COURTS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY ATTUNED TO THE ROLE THAT ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES PLAY IN MAINTAINING THE RULE OF LAW. THE COURTS HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT IN ORDER FOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES TO FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY, THEY MUST HAVE SOME FREEDOM TO INTERPRET THEIR STATUTES. ACCOMMODATION OF NONJUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS OF LAW, HOWEVER, HAS LIMITS. WHILE THE COURTS HAVE OFTEN ADDRESSED JURISDICTIONAL LIMITS IN DICEYAN TERMS, THEY HAVE ALSO ADDRESSED THE STRUCTURAL LIMITATIONS THAT FLOW FROM THE NATURE OF DELEGATED DISCRETION. THESE LIMITATIONS MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES TO MAKE DETERMINATIONS OF LAW AS COURTS DO. MOST AGENCIES DO NOT HAVE THE POWER TO CREATE BINDING POLICY OR OTHERWISE RESOLVE AMBIGUITIES IN THEIR ENABLING STATUTE. RULE OF LAW CONCERNS MAY ARISE FROM THE RESULTING UNCERTAINTY AS MUCH AS FROM QUESTIONS OF VIRES. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES ARE UNABLE TO SETTLE CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS OF CENTRAL IMPORTANCE TO THE LEGAL SYSTEM, OR JURISDICTIONAL DISPUTES BETWEEN AGENCIES. SETTLING AMBIGUITY IN EXISTING LAW IS A FUNCTION THAT ONLY THE COURTS CAN PERFORM. NONETHELESS, THE LEGITIMACY OF LAW-MAKING BY NONJUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THEIR LIMITS HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE COMMON LAW WORLD. THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEGAL PLURALISM REGARDING THE SOURCES OF LAW IN CANADIAN JURISPRUDENCE. THE ARTICLE THEN EXAMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH VAVILOV 'S NEW FRAMEWORK FOR REASONABLENESS REVIEW ARTICULATES HOW NONJUDICIAL DECISION-MAKERS MIGHT MANIFEST THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN A "CULTURE OF JUSTIFICATION."
43	THE PURPOSE OF THIS INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE APPLICATIONS OF MODERN COMPUTATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE FIELD OF CREDIT INVESTIGATION AND DISCUSS THE RELATED LEGAL GOVERNANCE MEASUREMENTS IN ORDER TO UNBLOCK THE BOTTLENECKS IN THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF CREDIT INVESTIGATION MARKET. BY ANALYZING THE COMPUTATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES AND ALGORITHMS MOST COMMONLY USED IN CREDIT DATA COLLECTION AND DATA STORAGE, DATA TRANSMISSION AND DATA ACCESS, DATA ANALYSIS AND PROCESSING, DATA CALCULATION, RESULT OUTPUT AND EFFECT EVALUATION, THIS PAPER SUMMARIZES AND PROPOSES A UNIFIED GENERAL PROCESS OF MODERN CREDIT INVESTIGATION, POINTING OUT THAT IN THIS GENERAL PROCESS, LOW DATA QUALITY, PRIVACY VIOLATION, ALGORITHMIC BIAS ARE THE MAIN CHALLENGES IN THE BIG DATA ERA, AND COUNTERMEASURES LIKE DATA QUALITY CONTROL, PRIVACY PROTECTION, AND ALGORITHM GOVERNANCE NEED TO BE TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY INTO ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO FURTHER EXPLORE THE GREAT POTENTIAL OF THE CREDIT INVESTIGATION UNDER THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK.
44	THE FIELD OF LAW AND STRATEGY (LAS) HAS ADVANCED OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW'S ROLE IN COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. TO DATE, HOWEVER, LAS HAS NEGLECTED LOW RULE OF LAW ENVIRONMENTS-COUNTRIES CHARACTERIZED BY EXPANSIVE DEGREES OF LEGAL UNCERTAINTY. LAS SHOULD ACCOUNT FOR THESE SETTINGS, TOO, SINCE ENVIRONMENTAL UNCERTAINTY IS A STRATEGICALLY SIGNIFICANT FACTOR FOR ANY COMPANY. THIS ARTICLE SITUATES THE STRATEGIC RELEVANCE OF LEGAL UNCERTAINTY IN THE CHINESE CONTEXT AND FILLS AN IMPORTANT GAP BY ILLUSTRATING HOW LAS PRINCIPLES APPLY IN LOW RULE OF LAW JURISDICTIONS. SPECIFICALLY, THIS ARTICLE DEVELOPS THE CONSTRUCT OF LEGAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP-THE NOTION THAT ATTORNEYS MAY APPLY AN ENTREPRENEURIAL MIND-SET AND SKILL SET TO POSITION THE CLIENT FAVORABLY AND LEGITIMATELY WITHIN THE UNCERTAINTIES OF THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE, THEREBY CREATING LEGAL COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES FOR THE CLIENT. DRAWING UPON INTERVIEWS WITH EXPERT ATTORNEYS AND EXECUTIVES, THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A TYPOLOGY OF LEGAL STRATEGIES AVAILABLE TO U.S. COMPANIES IN CHINA, UNIQUELY MODELING THESE APPROACHES ALONG THE TWO FUNDAMENTAL DIMENSIONS OF LEGAL STRATEGY. ADDITIONALLY, THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES TWO BASIC TYPES OF LEGAL UNCERTAINTY IN THE CROSS-BORDER CONTEXT AND OFFERS GUIDELINES FOR THE EXERCISE OF LEGAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP. TOGETHER, THESE ARGUMENTS DEMONSTRATE THAT LEGAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS AN EMPIRICALLY VIABLE CONSTRUCT WITHIN THE LAS PROJECT. IN LOW RULE OF LAW JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE EMBRACED FOREIGN ENTERPRISE, LEGAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP WILL GENERALLY OPTIMIZE THE AMERICAN COMPANY'S PURSUIT OF BOTH LEGAL VALUE CREATION AND LEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT.
45	THE CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY OF THE IRISH STATE 'TO DEFEND AND VINDICATE THE PERSONAL RIGHTS OF THE CITIZEN'IS THE BASIS OF A STRICT RULE EXCLUDING UNCONSTITUTIONALLY OBTAINED EVIDENCE. ALTHOUGH ENGLISH COURTS RECOGNISE A SIMILAR DUTY TO 'VINDICATE HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW', THEIR POWERS TO EXCLUDE EVIDENCE OR STAY PROCEEDINGS FOR ABUSE OF PROCESS ARE EXTREMELY FLEXIBLE AND DISCRETIONARY. IN BOTH JURISDICTIONS, THERE HAS BEEN PARTICULAR CONTROVERSY OVER THE APPLICATION OF THESE POWERS TO COVERT RECORDINGS THAT BREACH LEGAL PROFESSIONAL PRIVILEGE. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THE DUTY TO VINDICATE RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW UNDERPINS BOTH THE EXCLUSION OF UNLAWFULLY OBTAINED EVIDENCE AND THE PUNISHMENT OF OFFENDERS. IT REQUIRES A BALANCING EXERCISE, NOT BETWEEN DEFENDANTS' RIGHTS AND AN INCOMMENSURABLE PUBLIC INTEREST BUT, RATHER, BETWEEN TWO ASPECTS OF THE SAME CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY OF THE COURTS.
46	THE HIGH COURT DECISION IN MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION & MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS V JIA LEGENG (2001) 205 CLR 507 STILL RESONATES TODAY. A SERIOUSLY FLAWED ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL DECISION, FINDING MR JIA TO BE OF GOOD CHARACTER DESPITE HIS CONVICTION FOR RAPE IN AUSTRALIA, ENDED UP IN PROTRACTED LITIGATION AND RESULTED IN SERIOUS ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE RULE OF LAW IN IMMIGRATION DECISION-MAKING. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE COURSE OF THIS LITIGATION AND ARGUES THAT, DESPITE THE DEEPLY UNSYMPATHETIC NATURE OF THE APPLICANT, THE MAJORITY OF THE HIGH COURT WAS INCORRECT TO FIND THAT THE MINISTER'S DECISION WAS NOT AFFECTED BY ACTUAL BIAS AGAINST MR JIA. THE DECISION IN JIA HAS ALSO LED TO INCREASING CENTRALISATION OF DECISION-MAKING POWER IN THE MINISTER PERSONALLY, OFTEN WITHOUT RECOURSE TO MERITS REVIEW, AND THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THIS NEGATES THE RULE OF LAW IN SUCH CASES.
47	THE CLARIFICATION OF CONCEPTS IS IMPORTANT IN THE SYSTEMATISATION OF REPRESSIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE SOVIET UNION. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CONCEPTS IS THAT OF REPRESSION. THIS IS A LEGAL CONCEPT THAT BEARS IN MIND THE CONTENT OF PENALTIES. IN THE CASE OF THE SOVIET UNION, IT IS IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON THE MEANING OF THE PENALTY IN TERMS OF ITS CONTENT SINCE MEASURES THAT RESEMBLED PENALTIES WERE ALSO APPLIED IN THE SOVIET UNION WITHOUT FORMALLY REFERRING TO THEM AS PENALTIES. THE CONCEPT OF REPRESSION HELPS TO CONNECT MEASURES RESEMBLING PENALTIES TO PENALTIES THROUGH THEIR SIMILARITY IN TERMS OF CONTENT. A CLEAR DISTINCTION CANNOT BE MADE BETWEEN REPRESSIVE AND NON-REPRESSIVE MEASURES DUE TO THE LARGE RELATIVE PROPORTION OF STATE COERCION IN GOVERNING THE SOVIET UNION SINCE THE SEVERITY OF MEANS FOR ASSURING COERCION DIFFERED AND THE REPRESSIVENESS OF ALL MEANS CANNOT BE CLEARLY DEFINED. BRINGING CONCEPTS OF JUSTICE INTO PLAY ALSO INEVITABLY RAISES THE NEED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF TO WHAT EXTENT THE RESEARCH OF SOVIET REPRESSIONS OR OF THE HISTORY OF THE SOVIET UNION CAN RELY ON JUSTICE AT ALL. REGARDLESS OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE SPHERE REFERRED TO AS JUSTICE, THE SOVIET UNION WAS NOT A STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW AND WHEN USING LEGAL TERMINOLOGY IN REFERENCE TO THE SOVIET UNION, IT SHOULD BE PLACED IN QUOTATION MARKS. THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A METHOD OF EQUALISING MEANINGS AS A SOLUTION. ACCORDING TO THIS METHOD, THE ANALYSIS OF THE SOVIET UNION AND ITS LEGAL SYSTEM TAKES PLACE FROM THE POSITION OF A STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW BUT AT THE SAME TIME, SOVIET JUSTICE IS NOT IDENTIFIED WITH THE JUSTICE OF A STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. JUSTICE ACCORDING TO A STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW HAS A SUPPORTIVE ROLE. IT HELPS TO EXPLAIN THE FUNCTIONING OF THE SOVIET UNION AS A STATE THAT IS NOT BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. THE METHOD ALSO STRESSES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOVIET JUSTICE AND THE JUSTICE OF A STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW, AND THEIR ARTIFICIAL, FORMAL DOVETAILING. THE CONCEPT OF LEGAL PROVISIONS AND THE THREE-PILLAR THEORY OF PENAL LAW FORM THE BASIS FOR SYSTEMATISING SOVIET REPRESSIONS. REPRESSION CARRIED OUT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SOVIET LEGAL PROVISIONS WAS STANDARD REPRESSION, AND REPRESSION CARRIED OUT IN ACCORDANCE WITH OTHER ENACTMENTS WAS NON-STANDARD REPRESSION. THE MOST IMPORTANT CRITERION FOR DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN STANDARD LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND NON-STANDARD LEGAL INSTRUMENTS IS THE PUBLIC ACCESSIBILITY OF THE LEGAL INSTRUMENT. THE ADDITION OF A PREPARATORY STAGE FOR REPRESSION TO THE THREE PILLARS OF PENAL LAW (MATERIAL, PROCEDURAL LAW, AND EXECUTIVE LAW) CREATES A FOUR-LEVEL BACKGROUND SYSTEM, SO TO SPEAK, BY WHICH ONE TYPE OF REPRESSION CAN BE DIVIDED UP INTO DIFFERENT STAGES. THIS DIVISION PROVIDES A COMMON BASIS FOR COMPARING DIFFERENT TYPES OF REPRESSION AND MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO ALSO POINT OUT THE ATTRIBUTES THAT DISTINGUISH THEM FROM ONE ANOTHER. THIS MODE OF SYSTEMATISATION APPLIES FIRST AND FOREMOST TO THE SOVIET UNION OF THE STALIN ERA. EVEN THOUGH IT CAN BE EXTENDED TO THE POST-STALIN SOVIET UNION AS WELL, IT IS NEVERTHELESS NOT AS REPRESENTATIVE SINCE THE SOVIET LEGAL SYSTEM GRADUALLY BEGAN TO EXTERNALLY RESEMBLE A STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW AS A RESULT OF DE-STALINISATION, AND ASCERTAINING REPRESSION AFTER THE FACT THAT DID NOT CONFORM TO LEGAL PROVISIONS IS MORE DIFFICULT. THIS ARTICLE DIRECTS SEPARATE ATTENTION TO THE CONCEPT OF POLITICAL REPRESSION THAT HAS BEEN USED RELATIVELY EXTENSIVELY IN HISTORICAL LITERATURE, AND TO CATEGORISING REPRESSION AS JUSTIFIED AND NOT JUSTIFIED. IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEFINE THE CONCEPT OF POLITICAL REPRESSION. ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THIS MAY BE THE FACT THAT THESE CONCEPTS ARE GIVEN THE ADDITIONAL MEANING OF UNJUSTIFIED ACTS. THERE IS, HOWEVER, NO POINT IN CATEGORISING SOVIET REPRESSIONS AS JUSTIFIED AND UNJUSTIFIED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF LEGALITY BECAUSE THE SOVIET UNION WAS NOT A STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE LEGAL SENSE, ALL SOVIET REPRESSIONS WERE UNJUSTIFIED. ALL MODES OF REPRESSION CANNOT BE CLEARLY CATEGORISED USING THE MEANS OF SYSTEMATISING SOVIET REPRESSIONS PROPOSED IN THIS ARTICLE, YET IT AT LEAST PROVIDES SOME SORT OF FRAMEWORK FOR OBTAINING AN OVERVIEW OF REPRESSIONS. IT SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A DEVICE FOR DESCRIBING THE SYSTEM, NOT AS A DEVICE FOR PRECISELY DEFINING THE SYSTEM, NOT AS AN EXACT REFLECTION OF THE SYSTEM.
48	THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES FACTORS THAT EXPLAIN URBAN POVERTY BY FOCUSING ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL CAPITAL AND HOUSEHOLD WEALTH IN CAPE TOWN. DATA FROM A SURVEY (N = 1396) AMONG THE EXTREME AND RELATIVELY POOR IS UTILIZED. FACTOR ANALYSIS IS EMPLOYED TO IDENTIFY FACTORS THAT COMPOSE INSTITUTIONAL CAPITAL. PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS (PCA) IS USED TO DEVELOP THE HOUSEHOLD WEALTH VARIABLE FROM A LIST OF HOUSEHOLD ASSETS. MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS IS UTILIZED TO PREDICT THE EFFECT OF EXTRACTED FACTORS ON HOUSEHOLD WEALTH. RESULTS SHOW THAT INSTITUTIONAL CAPITAL COMPRISES RELIANCE ON (1) THE RULE OF LAW, (2) PUBLIC SERVICE PROVISION AND ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS, AND (3) POLITICAL LEADERSHIP, AND IS DISTINCT FROM SOCIAL CAPITAL. GREATER RELIANCE ON THE RULE OF LAW AND ON PUBLIC SERVICE PROVISION AND ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS PREDICTS HIGHER HOUSEHOLD WEALTH, WHILE COUNTERINTUITIVELY, GREATER RELIANCE ON POLITICAL LEADERSHIP PREDICTS LOWER HOUSEHOLD WEALTH.
49	BY THE LATE 1990S, INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PRESCRIBED A 'GOOD GOVERNANCE' PARADIGMTHAT SOUGHT TO EMPOWER THE JUDICIARY TO CURB 'STATE CAPTURE' BY THE CORRUPT POLITICAL ELITES OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. GOOD GOVERNANCE WAS SUPPOSED TO ACT AS A MIDWIFE TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, PROVIDING THE 'RULE OF LAW' FOR THE FREE MARKET REFORMS OF STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAMS THAT HAD HITHERTO FAILED TO PROVIDE MUCH SUCCESS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF 'GOOD GOVERNANCE' IN PAKISTAN, ARGUING THAT EMPOWERING THE JUDICIARY SERVED TO WEAKEN AN ALREADY WEAK LEGISLATURE. THE TANGIBLE ISSUES OF POPULAR POLITICAL REPRESENTATION AND ECONOMIC REDISTRIBUTIONWERE DISPLACED BY THE DISCOURSES ON THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND THE RULE OF LAW. BASED ON THIS EXPERIENCE, THE ARTICLE ENCOURAGES A SHIFT IN LAW AND DEVELOPMENTAL THEORIZING TO FOCUS ON FORMS OF LEGISLATURE AND DEMOCRATIC RULE AND A REDEFINED ROLE FOR THE 'CIVIL SOCIETY' WITHIN THIS.
50	NORWEGIAN FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENTS (FDI) HAVE GROWN RAPIDLY OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, REACHING A GLOBAL STOCK OF NOK 780 BILLION IN 2006. THE ARTICLE REPORTS ON A RESEARCH PROJECT EXAMINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NORWEGIAN FDI AND CORRUPTION, AS WELL AS POLITICAL, LABOUR AND 'RULE OF LAW' CONDITIONS IN HOST COUNTRIES. IT IS FOUND THAT FIRMS IN WHICH THE NORWEGIAN STATE HOLDS SUBSTANTIAL SHARES INVEST RELATIVELY MORE THAN DO PRIVATELY OWNED FIRMS IN HOST COUNTRIES CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH CORRUPTION AND LAX RULE OF LAW. IN A PARLIAMENTARY REPORT, NORWEGIAN AUTHORITIES STATE THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS ON FDI MORE EFFECTIVE AND THAT STATE-OWNED NORWEGIAN FIRMS SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO TAKE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ABROAD. THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE REALISM IN THIS DOUBLE CHALLENGE AND POINTS TO VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH REGULATION MAY BE ACHIEVED.
51	SINCE ITS ELECTION VICTORY IN 2010, THE PARTY FIDESZ, UNDER PRIME MINISTER VIKTOR ORBAN, HAS BEEN REMODELLING NOT ONLY HUNGARY'S POLITICAL SYSTEM, BUT ALSO ITS CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM. UNLIKE OTHER STATES BASED ON RULE OF LAW, THE NEW BASIC LAW DOES NOT INTEGRATE HUNGARIAN CITIZENS BEYOND THE LIMITS OF POLITICAL, RELIGIOUS, OR SOCIAL DIFFERENCES. RATHER, IT POLARISES AND EXCLUDES PARTS OF THE POPULATION. THE BASIC LAW EMBODIES A POLITICAL THOUGHT BASED ON THE LOGIC OF FRIEND OR FOE. THE INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE FORMED WITH THE HELP OF THE BASIC LAW IS TAILORED TO A ONE-PARTY STATE. MOREOVER, THE RECENT CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS SHOW: THE RULE OF LAW OVER POLITICS HAS BEEN REPLACED BY THE RULE OF POLITICS OVER LAW. THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN AUTHORITARIAN REGIME IS UNDERWAY. THE HUNGARIAN OPPOSITION AND EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS ARE NOW CALLED UPON.
52	BULGARIA'S EXPERIENCE WITH THE PROSECUTION OF POLITICAL CORRUPTION SUGGESTS THAT INCREASING THE POWER AND INSTITUTIONAL INDEPENDENCE OF THE COURTS IN NEW DEMOCRACIES DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT JUDGES WILL BE COMMITTED TO UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW.
53	ALTHOUGH THE HISTORICAL FUNCTION OF CRIMINAL COURTS TASKED WITH ADJUDICATING EPISODES OF MASS VIOLENCE IS WELL ESTABLISHED, THE PRECISE PURPOSE BEHIND NARRATING HISTORY WITHIN ATROCITY TRIALS REMAINS A MATTER OF CONTESTATION. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW CERTAIN DOMESTIC ATROCITY TRIALS HAVE CONSTRUCTED NARRATIVES OF THE PAST ALIGNED WITH THE NATION-BUILDING ASPIRATIONS OF THOSE STATES IN WHICH THEY WERE CONVENED. RATHER THAN FRAMING JUSTICE PRIMARILY IN TERMS OF UPHOLDING STANDARDS OF FAIRNESS TO THE ACCUSED OR RESPONDING TO THE NEEDS OF VICTIMS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES, THE DOMESTIC ATROCITY TRIALS EXAMINED IN THIS ARTICLE REFLECT A NOTION OF 'JUSTICE AS IDENTITY' WHEREBY THE CRIMINAL COURTROOM BECOMES A DIDACTIC MECHANISM OF NATION-BUILDING. THE ARTICLE EXAMINES TWO DOMESTIC ATROCITY TRIALS IN PARTICULAR - THE GERMAN TRIAL OF AUSCHWITZ GUARDS AND THE FRENCH TRIAL OF PAUL TOUVIER, A FORMER REGIONAL CHIEF OF THE VICHY MILICE. BY REVEALING HOW THESE TRIALS PRIORITIZED COMPETING CONCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW - THE AUSCHWITZ TRIAL RELYING ON A CONSERVATIVE CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW UNDERPINNED BY A STRICT LEGALITY CONCEPTION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY, AND THE TOUVIER TRIAL RELYING ON A MORE TRANSFORMATIVE CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW UNDERPINNED BY A SUBSTANTIVE JUSTICE CONCEPTION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY - THIS ARTICLE REVEALS AN IMPORTANT DIMENSION OF THE MECHANICS BY WHICH DOMESTIC ATROCITY TRIALS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEGITIMATE PARTICULAR CONCEPTIONS OF NATIONAL IDENTITY OUT OF SPECIFIC INTERPRETATIONS OF A NATION'S PAST.
54	IN VIEW OF THE ONGOING DEBATE ON AN ASIAN HUMAN RIGHTS MECHANISM, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES AN IMPRESSION OF THE WORK OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS DECIDING APPLICATIONS MADE UNDER THE EUROPEAN HUMAN RIGHTS CONVENTION BY CITIZENS FROM JURISDICTIONS AS DIVERSE AS THE UK, RUSSIA, FRANCE AND TURKEY. THE FOCUS IS ON CASES THAT ARE KEY TO THE RULE OF LAW, IE REVIEW AS TO CONSISTENCY WITH THE CONVENTION OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION AND POLICY RULES, THE CONSTITUTIONAL PLACE OF SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS, AND NATIONAL FORMATS OF JUDICIAL DECISION MAKING. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT THE EUROPEAN COURT, OPERATING AMIDST A WIDE VARIETY OF CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS, ADDS SUBSTANTIALLY TO JUDICIAL PROTECTION AND PROFESSIONALISM. THE PROCESS OF GLOBALISATION AND THE PRESSURE ON NATIONAL PUBLIC EXPENDITURE THAT IT ENTAILS, HOWEVER, DOES CONSTITUTE A NEWLY EMERGING THREAT TO JUDICIAL PROFESSIONALISM AND TO THE RULE OF LAW.
55	AS TWO PARTS OF ONE OVERARCHING LEGAL POSITIVIST PROJECT, IT IS LIKELY ASSUMED THAT THE CONSTITUTIVE ELEMENTS OF JOSEPH RAZ'S ANALYSIS OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE COMPATIBLE WITH HIS THINKING ON THE NATURE OF LEGAL AUTHORITY. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO CALL THIS ASSUMPTION INTO QUESTION BY READING RAZ IN LIGHT OF THE CORE, IF UNDER-RECOGNISED, PREOCCUPATION OF THE JURISPRUDENCE OF LON FULLER: NAMELY, THE LATTER'S CONCERN TO ILLUMINATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DISTINCTIVE FORM OF LAW AND HUMAN AGENCY. THIS NOT ONLY OPENS UP A NEW ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN RAZ AND FULLER THAT WAS FAR FROM EXHAUSTED WITHIN DEBATES ABOUT LAW AND MORALITY, BUT ALSO REVEALS TENSIONS BETWEEN RAZ'S ANALYSIS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND HIS ANALYSIS OF LEGAL AUTHORITY THAT PROPONENTS OF RAZ'S LEGAL POSITIVISM NEED TO ADDRESS.
56	THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT THE ATTEMPTS BY PRE- AND POST-UNION (1910) SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS TO CREATE EFFECTIVE SEDITION LAWS, PARTLY DIRECTLY TO CURB SPECIFIC POLITICAL OPPONENTS, BUT ALSO TO LICENSE AND FOCUS STATE INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING ACTIVITIES. SUPREME COURT JUDGES' ADHERENCE TO A RULE-OF-LAW FORMALISM IN A SUCCESSION OF COURT CASES BOTH HINDERED AND ENCOURAGED THESE ATTEMPTS. I AM PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN HOW THE COURTS' IMPOSITION OF MORE RIGOROUS STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE IN THE PRODUCTION OF EVIDENCE EVENTUALLY EXCEEDED THE STATE'S BUREAUCRATIC CAPABILITY AND UNDERMINED OFFICIALS' CONFIDENCE IN THE INSTRUMENTAL VALUE OF THE RULE OF LAW, LEADING ADMINISTRATORS TO ENACT LEGISLATION TO SUPPRESS THEIR POLITICAL ADVERSARIES WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE COURTS. THE JUDGES' STANCE IN THIS HISTORY WAS NOT ONE OF PROGRESSIVE OR SUDDEN CAPITULATION TO THE LAWMAKERS' AND EXECUTIVE'S WILL, AS IS SOMETIMES ARGUED, BUT NOTABLY CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT.
57	IN THIS ARTICLE WE HAVE TRIED TO ANSWER TO THE QUESTION 'WHY SOME ECONOMIES ARE DEVELOPED AND OTHER ECONOMIES ARE UNDERDEVELOPED?' FOR THIS, WE HAVE ENACTED AN EXPLANATION WHICH IS INSPIRED ON THE IDEAS OF DEPENDENCE THEORY AUTHORS AND WHICH IS BASED ON THREE PREMISES: BOTH PHENOMENA HAVE COMMON CAUSES; BOTH PHENOMENA HAVE OPPOSITE AND SYMMETRIC CAUSES; AND BOTH PHENOMENA ARE THE RESULT OF HISTORIC PROCESS WHICH ARRIVE TO OURS DAYS. THEN WE HAVE IDENTIFIED LIKE UNDERDEVELOPMENT CAUSES: THE COLONIAL EXPLOITATION; THE TRADE EXPLOITATION; THE FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION; THE PLENTY CURSE; THE HERITAGE DUAL SOCIAL STRUCTURE; THE NO-PERMANENT PRESENCE OF SOCIAL RULE OF LAW; AND THE GLOBAL APARTHEID. AND THE DEVELOPMENT CAUSES WILL BE: THE COLONIAL EXPLOITATION; THE TRADE EXPLOITATION; THE FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION; THE SCANT RESOURCES DISTRIBUTION; THE PLURAL SOCIAL STRUCTURE; THE PERMANENT PRESENCE OF SOCIAL RULE OF LAW; AND THE GLOBAL APARTHEID.
58	THE IMPORTANCE OF MARKET-SUPPORTING INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR IMPACT ON BUSINESS INVESTMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS GAINED THE ATTENTION OF RESEARCHERS AND PRACTITIONERS ALIKE. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXTEND THIS RESEARCH BY CAPTURING THE IMPACT OF THE QUALITY OF REGULATIVE INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS ON FIRM PERFORMANCE IN AN EMERGING MARKET CONTEXT. WE USE A SAMPLE OF 26,493 EMERGING MARKET FIRMS FROM 91 COUNTRIES OVER THE YEARS 2003 TO 2010 AND TEST FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, AND FIRM PERFORMANCE. RESULTS INDICATE THAT GOVERNMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS AND REGULATORY QUALITY IMPACT PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES POSITIVELY, WHILE RULE OF LAW IMPACTS PERFORMANCE NEGATIVELY. THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHTS AND ENCOURAGE MANAGERS AND PUBLIC POLICYMAKERS TO BE COGNIZANT OF THE IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS AND ADAPT ACCORDINGLY. (C) 2014 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.
59	THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEMATIC CONTEMPORARY CONCEPT OF STATE UNDER DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, IN WHICH CITIZENS PARTICIPATE DISCURSIVELY IN THE MAKING OF ALL RELEVANT POLITICAL DECISIONS, AND ARE, THEREFORE, AT THE SAME TIME AUTHORS AND RECEIVERS OF THE FINAL PROVISION. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS A NECESSARY PRIOR CONDITION TO AN EFFICACIOUS JUDICIALIZATION OF POLITICS. IT MAKES POSSIBLE THAT, IN THE FIELD OF ACTION OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH, THE BASIC VALUES AND NEEDS MAY BE, IN SOME WAY, PROVIDED FOR, WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE INDIVIDUALS' FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS OF CHOICE. MOREOVER, IT MAKES POSSIBLE THAT THE SAID VALUES AND NEEDS BE RECOGNIZED AS RIGHTS, AND BECOME PART OF THE PRACTICE OF CITIZENSHIP. THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, ACCORDING TO THIS CONCEPT, MAKES THIS POSSIBLE: THE SOCIAL SPACE, THE ARENA, WHERE THOSE INTERESTS AND NEEDS MANIFEST THEMSELVES AND CAN BE EFFECTIVELY CONTEMPLATED.
60	THE RULE OF LAW IS A PRINCIPLE UNDER WHICH ALL CITIZENS, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT, ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME LAWS THAT ARE PUBLICLY PROMULGATED AND EQUALLY ENFORCED. HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY DISCHARGE THEIR DUTIES AND PRESERVE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE LEGISLATURE FROM OTHER AREAS OF GOVERNMENT, MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT HAVE SPECIAL IMMUNITIES UNDER THE LAW OF PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGE. THESE SPECIAL IMMUNITIES, FIRST ENSHRINED BY THE BILL OF RIGHTS (1688), RESULT IN INVESTIGATIVE AND EVIDENTIARY RESTRICTIONS INVOLVING PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS. THIS PAPER EXPLORES PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGE IN AUSTRALIA AND HOW AUSTRALIAN JURISDICTIONS HAVE NAVIGATED THE COMPETING REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW OF PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGE AND THE RULE OF LAW. RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES IN LIGHT OF NEW INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES ARE PROPOSED TO ENSURE MATERIAL SUBJECT TO PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGE IS TREATED APPROPRIATELY AND THE INDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY OF PARLIAMENT IS MAINTAINED.
61	THE LAW OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA ON ADMINISTRATION OF ACTIVITIES OF OVERSEAS NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS IN THE MAINLAND OF CHINA (OVERSEAS NGO LAW), ADOPTED AT THE 20TH MEETING OF THE 12TH STANDING COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS ON 28 APRIL 2016, CAME INTO FORCE ON 1 JANUARY 2017. THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES EXPLAINED THAT THIS NEW LAW IS A MAJOR STEP "TO STANDARDISE AND GUIDE THE ACTIVITIES OF OVERSEAS NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS" IN LINE WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY "TO COMPREHENSIVELY PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW AND TO BUILD A SOCIALIST COUNTRY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW". HOWEVER, FOREIGN NGOS IN CHINA HAVE REACTED TO THE NEW LAW WITH GRAVE CONCERN AND ANXIETY. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES AN ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE LAW AND ASSESSES ITS INTENTION, IMPACT AND CONSEQUENCES.
62	MUCH CONTEMPORARY DISCUSSION OF MERCY HAS FOCUSED ON WHAT I CALL 'BENEFICENT MERCY': COMPASSIONATELY SPARING A PERSON FROM HARSH TREATMENT THAT SHE DESERVES. DRAWING ON SENECA'S DISCUSSION OF MERCY, I ARTICULATE A DIFFERENT CONCEPT OF MERCY WHICH I CALL 'CRITICAL MERCY': TREATING A PERSON JUSTLY WHEN UNJUST SOCIAL RULES CALL FOR HARSHER TREATMENT. WHEREAS BENEFICENT MERCY IS GROUNDED IN RECOGNITION OF IMPERFECTION IN HUMAN INDIVIDUALS, CRITICAL MERCY IS GROUNDED IN RECOGNITION OF IMPERFECTION IN HUMAN INSTITUTIONS. I ARGUE THAT POLITICAL COMMUNITIES HAVE REASON TO AUTHORIZE JUDGES TO GRANT CRITICAL MERCY IN CRIMINAL LAW. I CONTEND WITH THE OBJECTION THAT CRITICAL MERCY APPEARS TO VIOLATE THE IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW. I ARGUE THAT WHERE CERTAIN CONSTRAINTS ARE MET, RULE OF LAW VALUES IN FACT PROVIDE POSITIVE REASON TO AUTHORIZE JUDGES TO GRANT CRITICAL MERCY IN CRIMINAL LAW.
63	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE LINKS BETWEEN PEACE OPERATIONS AND COMBATING TRANSNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME. IT ARGUES THAT WHILE UN SECURITY COUNCIL MANDATES DIRECT UN MISSIONS TO SUPPORT ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW IN STATES THAT HOST PEACE OPERATIONS, THEIR ROLE IN ADDRESSING ORGANIZED CRIME IS MORE IMPLICIT THAN EXPLICIT. THIS ARTICLE NOTES, HOWEVER, THAT UN PANELS OF EXPERTS, SMALL FACT-FINDING TEAMS APPOINTED TO MONITOR TARGETED SANCTIONS, MAY OFFER INSIGHT INTO, AND OPTIONS FOR ADDRESSING, SUCH CRIMINAL NETWORKS. PANEL FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS, HOWEVER, ARE NOT INTEGRATED WITH RELATED UN EFFORTS TO BUILD THE RULE OF LAW. THIS LACK OF INTEGRATION REFLECTS A NEED, ON THE PART OF THE UN AND ITS MEMBER STATES, TO ADDRESS BETTER THE ABILITY OF PEACE OPERATIONS, UN PANELS OF EXPERTS, AND OTHER TOOLS FOR PEACEBUILDING TO CONTRIBUTE MORE EFFECTIVELY TO FIGHTING SPOILER NETWORKS AND ORGANIZED CRIME.
64	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES LINKAGES BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION, GLOBALISATION AND GOVERNANCE IN 44 COUNTRIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA USING DATA FOR THE PERIOD 2000-2012. THE GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENTS IS EMPLOYED AS EMPIRICAL STRATEGY. ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION IS PROXIED BY CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS WHEREAS GLOBALISATION IS APPRECIATED IN TERMS OF TRADE OPENNESS AND NET FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT INFLOWS. BUNDLED AND UNBUNDLED GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ARE USED, NAMELY: POLITICAL GOVERNANCE (CONSISTING OF POLITICAL STABILITY/NO VIOLENCE AND "VOICE & ACCOUNTABILITY"), ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE (ENCOMPASSING GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND REGULATION QUALITY), INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE (ENTAILING CORRUPTION-CONTROL AND THE RULE OF LAW) AND GENERAL GOVERNANCE (A COMPOSITE MEASUREMENT OF POLITICAL GOVERNANCE, ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE). THE FOLLOWING MAIN FINDING IS ESTABLISHED. TRADE OPENNESS MODULATES CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS TO HAVE POSITIVE NET EFFECTS ON POLITICAL STABILITY, ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE, THE RULE OF LAW AND GENERAL GOVERNANCE.
65	INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT (ISDS) GIVES RISE TO A PARTICULAR PHENOMENON WHERE INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL JUDGES THE FAIRNESS OF THE DOMESTIC COURTS OF A STATE. THE AUSTRALIAN COURTS IN THE PHILIP MORRIS CASE CAME CLOSE TO BEING JUDGED'. IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT CRITICISM SURROUNDING ISDS, PARTICULARLY THE INCONSISTENCY OF TRIBUNAL DETERMINATIONS, THE QUESTION THUS ARISES WHETHER THIS SYSTEM PROMOTES THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE EVALUATES WHETHER A PERMANENT INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT 'COURT, SUCH AS THAT PROPOSED BY THE EU AND CANADA, CONTRIBUTES TO CONSISTENCY AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN PARTICULAR, THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES CERTAIN ADEQUACIES AND INADEQUACIES OF THAT SYSTEM. THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT, WHILE CONSISTENT STANDARDS AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL MAY ACT AS A CATALYST BY PROVIDING THE NECESSARY FOUNDATION, ITS EVOLUTIONARY POTENTIAL TO BE A 'PUBLIC' COURT IN THE TRUE SENSE IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED.
66	THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO UNDERSTAND ATHENIAN ANTI-TYRANNY LAWS AS OFFERING A DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE TO EMERGENCY. THESE LAWS SOUGHT TO PROMOTE THE KILLING OF "TYRANTS" WHO OVERTHREW THE DEMOCRACY AND TO PUNISH THOSE WHO COLLABORATED WITH ANY NON-DEMOCRATIC REGIME. I ARGUE THAT THE ANTI-TYRANNY LAWS REFLECT A BROADER SERIES OF MEASURES ENACTED IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE OLIGARCHIC COUP OF 411 BCE THAT SOUGHT TO FACILITATE THE COLLECTIVE ACTION OF THE DEMOS (PEOPLE) AS A MEANS OF MAINTAINING AND PRESERVING ATHENIAN DEMOCRACY. SUCH LEGISLATION, I SUGGEST, IS BEST UNDERSTOOD WHEN SITUATED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A DISTINCTLY ATHENIAN CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT VIEWED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY IN RECURSIVE TERMS. THE ARTICLE PLACES THIS ATHENIAN RESPONSE TO EMERGENCY IN DIALOGUE WITH RECENT WORK ON EMERGENCY POLITICS IN CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY.
67	HOW CAN THE IDEA OF THE 'RULE OF LAW' BE MADE A REALITY FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES WHERE CUSTOMARY LAW STILL UNDERPINS POPULAR EXPERIENCE OF 'LAW AS PRACTICE'? IT IS ARGUED THAT THE IDEA OF LAW ITSELF SHOULD INCLUDE ALL NON-STATE 'NORMATIVE ORDERS' THAT ARE KNOWN, ACCEPTABLE AND PRE-DETERMINED, AS WELL AS SLATE LAW. WHAT IS CALLED CUSTOMARY LAW IS OFTEN CLOSER TO OBSERVED SOCIAL NORMS (PRACTISED LAW) THAN THE STATE LAW IMPORTED BY COLONIALISM, AND INDEED EVOLVES IN LINE WITH SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGE, PARTICULARLY IN THE FIELD OF LAND TENURE. ANY NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW MUST SUPPORT THE INSTITUTIONS OF CUSTOMARY LAW. ONE PROBLEM, HOWEVER, IS THAT IN ANY COUNTRY THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT BODIES OF CUSTOMARY LAW PARTICULAR TO DIFFERENT LOCALITIES, REGIONS, CULTURES. THIS DIVERSIFY MUST BE BOTH RESEARCHED AND RECOGNISED.
68	DEALING WITH HIGH-RISK CRIMINALS AFTER RELEASE FROM PREVENTIVE DETENTION PUTS THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE, GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW, TO A TOUGH TEST. BALANCING FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF FORMER INMATES WITH THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO PROTECTION IS GOVERNED BY THE STATES' PROVISIONS CONCERNING POLICE POWERS, BY THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION'S PROVISIONS ON LEGISLATIVE POWERS. THUS, CONSTANT OBSERVATION OF FORMER INMATES BY STATE POLICE OFFICERS IS IN BREACH OF GERMANY'S CONSTITUTION. A EXTENSIVE INTERPRETATION OF FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE POWER DERIVING FROM ART. 74 1 NO. 1 GG BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT LEAVES THE STATE'S REMAINING LEGISLATIVE POWER TO GOVERN CONSTANT OBSERVATIONS AS MERELY THEORETICAL. MORE LIKELY WILL BE A PROVISION IN THE FEDERAL PENAL CODE RESPECTIVELY THE PENAL PROCEDURE CODE CONCERNING THE SUPERVISION OF CONDUCT (FAHRUNGSAUFSICHT) THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR MEASURES OF CONSTANT OBSERVATION.
69	RELIGION IS COMMONLY DEEMED TO HAVE RETURNED TO PUBLIC LIFE IN WAYS THAT CALL ATTENTION TO LEGAL FRAMEWORKS AND JUDGMENTS. RELATIVELY LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO LAW AND RELIGION INTERNATIONALLY, HOWEVER. THIS ESSAY OFFERS INITIAL OBSERVATIONS ABOUT REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCCESS IN THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN LAW AND RELIGION, AND THE NEED FOR MEMBERS OF THE ABRAHAMIC FAITHS ESPECIALLY TO REASON TOGETHER AND WITH INTERNATIONAL LAWYERS, WHETHER BELIEVERS OR NOT, ABOUT LEGAL ORDER IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA. PARTICULAR REFERENCE IS MADE TO WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN IN PROTESTANT THOMIST PERSPECTIVE TO AFFIRM THE 'RULE OF LAW' AND HOW THE INCLUSION OF RELIGIOUS VOICES IN CONTESTED DEBATES ABOUT THE MEANING OF THE 'RULE OF LAW' MAY ASSIST DELIBERATION IN DIVERSE INTERNATIONAL CONTEXTS IN THE CONTEXT OF TARGETED KILLINGS, INCLUDING IN THE TERRITORIES OF OTHER STATES BY ARMED COMBAT AERIAL VEHICLES OR 'DRONES'.
70	THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES HOW THE EVOLUTION OF THE RULE OF LAW TO THE SOCIAL STATE OF LAW GENERATED, AMONG OTHER LEGAL SCENARIOS, A CHANGE IN THE INTERPRETATION OF THE NORM, THUS, THE EMERGENCE OF SUCH A CONCEPT AND THE ELEMENTS THAT MAKE IT UP, SHOULD NOT ONLY BE CONSIDERED AS CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS, BUT ALSO AS A HERMENEUTICAL PARAMETER WHICH MUST BE PRESENT FROM THE PROCESS OF NORMATIVE CREATION TO ITS APPLICATION. ALTHOUGH, WITHIN INTERPRETIVE PROCESSES THERE IS A RANGE OF METHODS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THE IMPORTANCE AND SCOPE OF THE CONCEPT OF SOCIAL RULE OF LAW AS ONE OF THOSE, THIS BECAUSE WHEN WE FIND OURSELVES IN A CONSTITUTIONAL STATE THE CRITERIA SET FORTH IN THE STANDARD OF NORMS AND ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY, SUCH PARAMETERS MUST BE COMPLIED WITH IN DIFFERENT SCENARIOS WITHIN THE LEGAL FIELD.
71	HOW IS RULE OF LAW ESTABLISHED? WE ADDRESS THIS QUESTION BY EXPLORING THE EFFECT OF INCREASES IN FISCAL CAPACITY ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF WELL-ENFORCED, FORMAL, LEGAL STANDARDS IN A PREINDUSTRIAL ECONOMY. BETWEEN 1550 AND 1700, THERE WERE OVER 2,000 WITCH TRIALS IN FRANCE. PROSECUTING A WITCH REQUIRED LOCAL JUDGES TO SIGNIFICANTLY DEVIATE FROM FORMAL RULES OF EVIDENCE. HENCE, WE EXPLOIT THE SIGNIFICANT VARIATION ACROSS TIME AND SPACE IN WITCH TRIALS AND FISCAL CAPACITY ACROSS FRENCH REGIONS BETWEEN 1550 AND 1700 TO SHOW THAT INCREASES IN FISCAL CAPACITY WERE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED ADHERENCE TO THE FORMAL RULE OF LAW. AS FISCAL CAPACITY INCREASED, LOCAL JUDGES INCREASINGLY UPHELD DE JURE RULES, AND THE FREQUENCY OF WITCH TRIALS DECLINED. PROLONGED WITCH HUNTING IS AS GOOD A BAROMETER AS ANY FOR MEASURING WEAKNESS IN A STATE. (SOMAN 1989, P. 17)
72	HONG KONG HAS BEEN A PLACE WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS UPHELD AS THE CORNERSTONE OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM, AND THE NOTION OF RULE OF LAW IS BASED VERY MUCH ON RETRIBUTORY JUSTICE - A SYSTEM WHERE DEFENDANTS ARE GIVEN SUFFICIENT DUE PROCESS PROTECTION, AND PROPORTIONATE PUNISHMENT IS LEVIED IN A LEGAL SENSE. IN THE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION PROCESS, RESTORATIVE JUSTICE EXISTS IN A PERIPHERAL WAY IN THE FORM OF VICTIM OFFENDER MEDIATION. THOUGH NAMED AS A FORM OF MEDIATION, THE PRACTICE OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE HAS BEEN RECEIVING MUCH LESSER ATTENTION WHEN THE USE OF MEDIATION IN THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS ENJOYED HUGE GROWTH IN THE TERRITORY. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW THE PROMOTION OF MEDIATION IN HONG KONG HAS SUPPORTED POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENT OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE THROUGH THE WELL-ESTABLISHED POOL OF PROFESSIONALS, LAWYERS AND HELPING PROFESSIONALS INCLUDED, IN THE FIELD.
73	THIS STUDY ASSESSES HOW THE MOBILE PHONE INFLUENCES GOVERNANCE TO IMPROVE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT) EXPORTS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA WITH DATA FROM 2000 TO 2012. THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS BASED ON THE GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENTS AND THREE MAIN GOVERNANCE CONCEPTS ARE USED, NAMELY (I) INSTITUTIONAL (COMPRISING THE RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION CONTROL), (II) POLITICAL (INVOLVING POLITICAL STABILITY/NO VIOLENCE AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY) AND (III) ECONOMIC (INCLUDING REGULATION QUALITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS) GOVERNANCE. THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS ARE ESTABLISHED. FIRST, THERE ARE POSITIVE NET EFFECTS ON ICT GOODS EXPORTS FROM INDEPENDENT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MOBILE PHONES AND 'POLITICAL STABILITY', 'VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY' AND CORRUPTION CONTROL. SECOND, SIGNIFICANT NET EFFECTS ARE NOT APPARENT FROM INDEPENDENT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MOBILE PHONES AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATION QUALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED.
74	STAFFED BY INTERNATIONAL POLICE OFFICERS, PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES, EULEX WAS MANDATED TO STRENGTHEN KOSOVO'S DOMESTIC RULE-OF-LAW INSTITUTIONS AND ENDOWED WITH EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY TO ENSURE THAT HIGH-LEVEL CRIMINAL CASES, INCLUDING ORGANISED CRIME, ARE PROPERLY INVESTIGATED AND PROSECUTED. YET, AFTER MORE THAN NINE YEARS OF OPERATION, EULEX HAS PROVEN LARGELY INEFFECTIVE IN USING ITS EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY TO COUNTER ORGANISED CRIME AND ITS CAPACITY-BUILDING EFFORTS HAVE NOT LED TO SIGNIFICANT LOCAL IMPROVEMENTS IN THIS AREA. INSUFFICIENT FRAMEWORK CONDITIONS SHAPED BY YEARS OF IMPUNITY FOR POLITICO-CRIMINAL POWER STRUCTURES PREVENT CAPACITY-BUILDING EFFORTS FROM TAKING EFFECT AS LOCAL RULE-OF-LAW INSTITUTIONS REMAIN HESITANT AND TIMID TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE HIGH-LEVEL CRIMINALS. IT IS ARGUED THAT EULEX'S OWN CONDUCT AND WEAK EXECUTIVE PERFORMANCE HAS SEVERELY UNDERMINED THE MISSION'S EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THROUGH CAPACITY-BUILDING.
75	THIS PAPER INTEND TO APPROACH THE ISSUE WHICH INVOLVES THE CONDITIONS AND POSSIBILITIES FOR CRIMINALIZATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE ACT OF THE APPOINTING PEOPLE TO POSITIONS IN CHARGE THAT NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY CONDITIONS REQUIRED BY THE RULE OF LAW.
76	THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A REUNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS CONVENTIONALLY CALLED CHINA'S LEGAL SYSTEM. IT ARGUES THAT A NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS ABOUT ITS INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT PLAUSIBLY EXPLAINED USING THE CONVENTIONAL VOCABULARY AND CONCEPTS OF LEGALITY. WHEN WE SEE INCONSISTENCIES, WE TEND TO EXPLAIN THEM AS SIGNS OF THE IMMATURITY OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM, OR AS MISTAKES, OR AS UNREPRESENTATIVE ABERRATIONS. THIS KIND OF EXPLANATION IS DRIVEN BY A CONSCIOUS OR SUBCONSCIOUS CONVERGENCE THEORY. BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE THESE INCONSISTENCIES SERIOUSLY AND COME UP WITH A THEORY DOES NOT REQUIRE US TO TREAT THEM AS INCONSISTENCIES; A THEORY THAT TREATS THEM AS FEATURES, NOT BUGS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT CHINA HAS BEEN BUILDING A SYSTEM FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF ORDER AND THE POLITICAL PRIMACY OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY ("CCP"), NOT FOR THE DELIVERY OF JUSTICE. IT URGES THAT WE SHOULD NOT MAKE ETHNOCENTRIC ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOW VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS IN CHINA-OR INDEED IN ANY SOCIETY WITH WHICH WE ARE NOT FAMILIAR-DO OR SHOULD OPERATE MERELY ON THE BASIS OF SIMILARITY OF (TRANSLATED) NAME OR APPARENT ISOMORPHISM. IF TOO MANY OBSERVATIONS DON'T FIT THE MODEL, THEN IT'S TIME TO CHANGE THE MODEL, NOT TO DISMISS THE OBSERVATIONS. THE ARGUMENT PRESENTED HERE-THAT WE SHOULD LOOK BEYOND THE "RULE OF LAW" MODEL AS THE SOLE WAY OF ANALYZING AND MEASURING A SOCIETY'S ORDER MAINTENANCE INSTITUTIONS-HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNANCE BEYOND JUST CHINA. IT IS CUSTOMARY TO LOCATE AUTHORITARIAN, NON-DEMOCRATIC STATES AT A MIDPOINT ON A SPECTRUM WITH NO RULE OF LAW AT ONE END AND PERFECT RULE OF LAW AT THE OTHER, THE MIDPOINT BEING LABELED "RULE BY LAW." BUT "RULE BY LAW" TURNS OUT TO BE A THIN AND UNSATISFACTORY CONCEPT. APPLYING THIS LABEL AMOUNTS TO SAYING NOT MUCH MORE THAN THAT THE INSTITUTIONS IN QUESTION DON'T MEASURE UP TO THE RULE-OF-LAW STANDARD. WE MUST LEARN TO LOOK FOR THE APPARENT OUTLIERS, THE ERRORS AND IMPERFECTIONS, AND TO ASK OURSELVES WHETHER THEY CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO A DIFFERENT PARADIGM THAT TREATS THEM AS NORMAL AND EXPECTED. WE MIGHT WELL FIND THAT THE VARIETY OF HUMAN INSTITUTIONS IS FAR RICHER THAN WE HAD IMAGINED.
77	WITH THE CONTINUOUS ADVANCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN SOCIETY, THE PACE OF GLOBAL INTEGRATION IS ACCELERATING, AND ALL COUNTRIES ARE ACTIVELY EXPANDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEA AREAS. THE PREVIOUS MARITIME NAVIGATION MANAGEMENT MODEL CANNOT MEET THE CONDITIONS FOR ACTIVE OCEAN DEVELOPMENT IN THE NEW ERA. THE STATE MUST MANAGE SHIPS. MY COUNTRY HAS ESTABLISHED A SERIES OF LEGAL SYSTEMS FOR SHIP MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING SHIP INSPECTION SYSTEMS, SHIP REGISTRATION SYSTEMS, AND SHIP SAFETY INSPECTION SYSTEMS. NEW MANAGEMENT MODELS, NEW SERVICE CONCEPTS, AND PROSPECTS HAVE GRADUALLY BECOME THE FOCUS OF ATTENTION OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN WATERWAY MANAGERS. WITH THE CONTINUOUS ADVANCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN OUR COUNTRY, THE LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS OF MARITIME NAVIGATION MANAGEMENT ARE ALSO GETTING HIGHER AND HIGHER. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CREATE A GOOD LEGAL ENVIRONMENT. THIS ARTICLE IS AIMED AT STUDYING HOW TO PLAY THE ROLE OF WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORK IN MARITIME NAVIGATION MANAGEMENT AND HOW TO ESTABLISH A RELATIVELY COMPLETE LEGAL SYSTEM. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A GRAY FUZZY COMPREHENSIVE ALGORITHM. IF THE FUZZY SUBSET METHOD IS USED TO DETERMINE THE MEMBERSHIP MATRIX IN THE FUZZY COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION, THEN THERE WILL BE A SUDDEN DROP IN THE DEGREE OF MEMBERSHIP DUE TO A SLIGHT CHANGE IN THE CRITICAL VALUE OF THE INDEX LEVEL. BASED ON THIS ALGORITHM, A SET OF PRELIMINARY MODELS OF MARITIME CHANNEL MANAGEMENT IS ESTABLISHED. THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA IN THIS ARTICLE MENTIONS THAT IN 2017-2020, THE PERCENTAGE OF A CERTAIN MARITIME MANAGEMENT'S ATTENTION TO THE LEGAL SYSTEM HAS CLEARLY SHOWN AN UPWARD TREND. IN 2020, THE ATTENTION TO THE LEGAL SYSTEM IS EVEN AS HIGH AS 69%. IT CAN BE SEEN THAT SUPERVISION IMPROVING THE LEGAL SYSTEM IS AN EFFECTIVE MEASURE. FROM THE DATA, WE CAN SEE THAT THE RULE OF LAW SCORE IN 2018 WAS ABOUT 1.5 POINTS LOWER THAN THAT IN 2019, AND THE RULE OF LAW SCORE IN 2019 WAS 7.5 POINTS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ADMINISTRATION ACCORDING TO LAW PUTS FORWARD HIGHER REQUIREMENTS ON THE ABILITY AND SERVICE LEVEL OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES AND THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL, ESPECIALLY IN THE PROCESS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, DEALING WITH AFFAIRS RELATED TO ADMINISTRATIVE COUNTERPARTS. THEREFORE, IT IS VERY NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH A COMPLETE LEGAL SYSTEM.
78	THE DISCUSSION OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE KICKED OFF BY IMPRISONED FORMER OLIGARCH MIKHAIL KHODORKOVSKY'S JUNE 2009 ARTICLE "RUSSIA AWAITING TRIAL" REVEALS THE INCOMPATIBILITY BETWEEN THE GOAL OF A "RULE OF LAW" STATE AND THE REALITY OF THE "POWER VERTICAL."
79	DRIVEN BY THE PROMISE OF INCREASED EFFICIENCIES AND COST-SAVINGS, THE PUBLIC SECTOR HAS SHOWN MUCH INTEREST IN AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING (ADN) TECHNOLOGIES. HOWEVER, THE RULE OF LAW AND FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNMENT ARE BEING LOST ALONG THE WAY.
80	THE ARTICLE GIVES A HISTORICAL ANALYSIS OF THE EVOLUTION OF THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE RUSSIAN CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LEGISLATION AND GIVEN PERIODIZATION OF BECOMING CRIMINAL PROCEDURE GUARANTEES THE LEGALITY OF THE INVESTIGATION OF CRIMES COMMITTED BY JUVENILES.
81	IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THIS CENTURY MOST OF THE LEGAL AND JUDICIAL REFORM WORK OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES (HEREAFTER IDAS) FOCUSED MAINLY ON STATE INSTITUTIONS. TODAY, THINGS HAVE CHANGED. AFTER THE DISAPPOINTING OUTCOMES OF MANY YEARS OF LEGAL AND JUDICIAL REFORM AND IN VIEW OF THE ENORMOUS CHALLENGES POSED BY STATE BUILDING IN NUMEROUS FRAGILE AND FAILED STATES, IDAS ARE BEGINNING TO ACCEPT THAT GOVERNANCE AND JUSTICE MECHANISMS THAT OPERATE EITHER OUTSIDE THE FRAMEWORK OF THE STATE OR IN THE FRINGES BETWEEN STATE AND SOCIETY - NON-STATE JUSTICE SYSTEMS (HEREAFTER NSJS) - ARE INDISPENSABLE COMPONENTS OF REFORM PROCESSES AIMED AT IMPROVING THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF LEGAL AND JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE MATERIALS DISCUSSED IN THIS PAPER, DRAWN FROM LATIN AMERICA AND AFRICA, SUGGEST THAT ANY SUCCESSFUL ENGAGEMENT WITH NSJS REQUIRES A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH LOCAL STATE STRUCTURES AND POLITICAL PROCESSES. IT ALSO REQUIRES AN IN-DEPTH UNDERSTANDING OF THE STATE AND COMMUNITY WITHIN WHICH NSJS OPERATE. INDEED, AS THIS PAPER SHOWS, SUCCESSFUL ENGAGEMENT SHOULD BE SEEN AS PART OF A CONTINUING PROCESS OF STATE BUILDING. UNLESS IDAS ARE WILLING TO TAKE A WIDER AND MORE POLITICAL APPROACH TO THEIR INVOLVEMENT WITH NSJS, THEY WILL NOT ACHIEVE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS IN RULE OF LAW AND GOVERNANCE PROJECTS.
82	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE CENTRAL ROLE OF PUBLIC MEMORY OF RADICAL INJUSTICE-OR THE SYSTEMATIC DENIAL BY A REGIME OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL RESPECT FOR PERSONS UNDER THE RULE OF LAW-IN CREATING AND PRESERVING A LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC REGIME. MY CONTENTION IS THAT, IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT, EFFORTS TO DENY EQUAL RESPECT IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY TO ENTIRE GROUPS OF PEOPLE MUST BE REMEMBERED BY A SOCIETY-INDEED, THERE IS A MORAL OBLIGATION TO DO SO. AND WHEN THESE EVENTS ARE REMEMBERED, THE BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING THE RULE OF LAW IN SOCIETY ON BEHALF OF CIVIC EQUALITY IS MORE LIKELY. A PUBLIC MEMORY OF RADICAL INJUSTICE HAS BECOME MUCH STRONGER IN THE COUNTRIES OF EASTERN EUROPE THAN IN RUSSIA, AND I SPECULATE WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE ARE LIKELY TO BE FOR THE POLITICAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THE COUNTRIES OF EASTERN EUROPE.
83	THE MAKING OF A MARKET ECONOMY IN CHINA OCCURRED WHEN THE DOMESTIC LEGAL SYSTEM WAS LARGELY UNDERDEVELOPED. IT IS THE ADMINISTRATIVE BUREAUCRATIC SYSTEM THAT HAS PLAYED A LEADING ROLE IN THE MAKING OF A MARKET ECONOMY IN CHINA. IN RECENT YEARS, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS STRIVED TO ESTABLISH A MARKET ECONOMY BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW AND HAS UNDERTAKEN LEGAL MEASURES TO RATIONALISE GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF MARKET ECONOMY DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE BUREAUCRATIC SYSTEM HEADED BY THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT REMAINS A STRONG PARTY LEADING THE MARKET ECONOMY CONSTRUCTION IN CHINA. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE BUREAUCRATIC SYSTEM AND MARKET ECONOMY DEVELOPMENT HAVE EVOLVED INTO A SOCIAL INSTITUTION. TO TRANSFORM THE REGULATION OF MARKET ECONOMY DEVELOPMENT TOWARDS THE RULE OF LAW IS A SOCIAL INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE AND IS A SLOW AND INCREMENTAL PROCESS, AS IT IS IMBEDDED IN THE VARIOUS FORMAL AND INFORMAL CONSTRAINTS IN CHINESE SOCIETY.
84	HUNGARY AND POLAND HAVE SEEN THE MOST WIDESPREAD EROSION OF DEMOCRACY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION SINCE FIDESZ AND LAW AND JUSTICE STARTED THEIR AUTHORITARIAN REMAKING IN 2010 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY. DESPITE THE EU'S INTRODUCTION OF VARIOUS DOCTRINAL INNOVATIONS, IT COULD NOT FORCE THESE REGIMES TO COMPLY WITH THE CORE VALUES OF THE EU. WHILE THE LITERATURE HAS FOCUSED ON THE FORMAL VIOLATION OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE LINKS BETWEEN INFORMAL POWER AND THE LIMITED CONSTRAINING ROLE OF THE EU HAVE REMAINED UNDERTHEORIZED. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO FILL THE GAP BY STUDYING THE INFORMAL EXERCISE POWER OF THE FIDESZ AND PIS GOVERNMENTS THAT HELPED THEM TO CREATE AN UNEVEN POLITICAL PLAYING FIELD. CONNECTING THE LITERATURE ON HYBRID AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES AND INFORMALITY, IT WILL BE SHOWN THROUGH THREE MAIN DOMAINS HOW THE HUNGARIAN AND POLISH GOVERNMENTS (1) DISTRIBUTED INFORMAL POLITICAL-ECONOMIC DECISION-MAKING POWER INFORMALLY THROUGHOUT CLIENTELIST CORRUPTION, (2) CAPTURED THE MEDIA THROUGH LOYAL OLIGARCHS/ALLIES, AND (3) EMPLOYED ELECTORAL CLIENTELISM TO TILT THE ELECTORAL PLAYING FIELD IN THEIR FAVOR. WHILE THE STUDY PROPOSES A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK RELATED TO THE HUNGARIAN AND POLISH EXAMPLES, IT IS ALSO A WARNING FOR THE EU TO TAKE THE INFORMAL EXERCISE OF POWER SERIOUSLY.
85	BASED ON AN ORIGINAL LARGE-N DATASET OF INDIVIDUAL UKRAINIAN OLIGARCHS AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE, THIS ARTICLE TESTS COMPETING PERSPECTIVES ON THE POLITICAL POWER OF BIG CAPITAL. WE FIND, SURPRISINGLY, THAT NEITHER THE ASSUMPTION OF DIRECT POWER BY THE OLIGARCHS NOR THE MOBILITY OF OLIGARCHIC ASSETS HELPS TYCOONS PROTECT THEIR FORTUNES AGAINST SHOCKS. INSTEAD, THE INDIRECT STRATEGIES OF PARTY SUPPORT AND MEDIA OWNERSHIP SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE BUSINESS WEALTH. EMPIRICALLY, WE PROFILE POSTCOMMUNIST OLIGARCHS BY EXAMINING THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES OF 177 OLIGARCHS FROM 2006 TO 2012. THEORETICALLY, WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE LITERATURES ON INSTRUMENTAL AND STRUCTURAL POWER OF CAPITAL, AND ON THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN EXTREME WEALTH, RULE OF LAW, AND DEMOCRACY. IN DOING SO, WE CONTRAST THE LOGIC OF FLEXIBILITY, ACCORDING TO WHICH OLIGARCHS BENEFIT FROM POLITICAL ADAPTABILITY AND DENIABILITY, WITH THE LOGIC OF COMMITMENT COMPENSATION, ACCORDING TO WHICH OLIGARCHS BENEFIT FROM DIRECT POWER WHEN THE RULE OF LAW IS WEAK.
86	WHEN LEGAL PRACTICE SATISFIES CERTAIN MODEST CONDITIONS OF LEGITIMACY, AFFIRMING THE EQUAL DIGNITY OF PERSONS, THE LAW IS WHAT IT OUGHT TO BE. IT PROVIDES THE MORALLY APPROPRIATE BASIS FOR THE RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO MAY DISAGREE ABOUT WHAT JUSTICE, IDEALLY CONCEIVED, REQUIRES. SPECIFIC RULES OR RULINGS ARE PROPERLY INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE, WHICH TRACKS THE NATURE AND BOUNDARIES OF LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT. PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE MORAL STANDARDS ARE ENCOMPASSED WITHIN AN APPROPRIATE CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE LAW IS THEREBY CONSTITUTED THE MEASURE OF JUSTICE FOR THE POLITICAL COMMUNITY: A PUBLIC CONCEPTION OF JUSTICE IS SUBSTITUTED FOR CONFLICTING PRIVATE ONES. OUR LEGAL OBLIGATIONS ARE PRECISELY THE MORAL OBLIGATIONS WE OWE AS CITIZENS, FAITHFUL TO THAT COMMUNITY. WE HONOUR THE DEMANDS OF JUSTICE BY OBEDIENCE TO LAW - THE LAW THAT OBTAINS IN VIRTUE OF ADHERENCE TO THE IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW.
87	THE REALITY THAT SOCIAL CONTRADICTIONS ARE INTENSIFYING IN SOME PARTS OF CHINA HAS REVEALED SOME INESCAPABLE DEFECTS IN THE CURRENT STAGE OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND HAS PRESENTED NEW CHALLENGES TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE. JUSTICE IS A CRUCIAL FACTOR IN EFFECTIVE LINKAGES BETWEEN SOCIAL GOVERNANCE AND THE PATH TO THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE ATTAINMENT OF GOOD SOCIAL GOVERNANCE THROUGH JUSTICE IS A BASIC MARKER OF A RULE OF LAW SOCIETY. USING THE RATIONAL CHOICE FRAMEWORK TO EXAMINE REPRESENTATIVE INDIVIDUAL CASES, WE CAN SEE THAT THEORIES OF PARTICIPATORY GOVERNANCE, SELF-GOVERNANCE AND POLYCENTRIC GOVERNANCE PROVIDE AN APPROACH TO THE INTERPRETATION OF EXTREME SOCIAL CONTRADICTIONS AND THE REDUCTION OF SOCIAL CONFLICTS, THUS CONSTITUTING A THEORETICAL SUPPORT AND GUIDING DIRECTION FOR THE REFORM OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. THIS WILL ENABLE US TO CREATE A DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISM CONSISTENT WITH THE CONCEPT OF SOCIETAL GOVERNANCE AND JUDICIAL PRINCIPLES.
88	THE RULE OF LAW IS ESSENTIAL FOR A COUNTRY'S DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, PROVIDING ONE OF THE INGREDIENTS FOR STABILITY IN NEWLY DEMOCRATIZING COUNTRIES THAT EVENTUALLY PROMOTES STRONG JUDICIAL SYSTEMS. LIKELY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO WEAKNESSES IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEMS INCLUDE THE ABSENCE OF FUNCTIONAL LEGAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS, ESPECIALLY THE AVAILABILITY OF JUDICIAL DECISIONS, AS WELL AS THE INABILITY OF THE POPULACE GENERALLY TO ACCESS LEGAL MATERIAL AND LEGAL INFORMATION. TAKING KENYA AS AN EXAMPLE AND USING THE US JUDICIAL PROCESS AS A FOIL, THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE PROPOSITION THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF JUDICIAL DECISIONS IN CASE REPORTERS ENHANCES DEMOCRACY BY INCREASING JUDICIAL TRANSPARENCY AND CONTRIBUTING TO SOME PREDICTABILITY IN THE LAW, THUS ENHANCING THE RULE OF LAW. THE PAPER ALSO EMPHASIZES THE CRUCIAL ROLE THAT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND THE INTERNET COULD HAVE IN ADVANCING ACCESS TO LEGAL INFORMATION. (C) 2004 ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
89	THE ARTICLE AIMS TO STUDY THE ROLE AND IMPORTANCE OF AN EXPERT AND LINGUISTIC SUPPORT OF LAW DRAFTING AS A MEAN OF IMPROVING THE NATIONAL LEGISLATION OF UKRAINE. THE WORK IS BASED ON THE APPLICATION OF DESCRIPTIVE, SYSTEMATIC, LOGICAL-LEGAL, HERMENEUTIC, STATISTICAL, COMPARATIVE-LEGAL METHODS OF LEGAL RESEARCH AND THE METHOD OF ALTERNATIVES. THE RESEARCH MATERIALS INCLUDE NORMATIVE LEGAL ACTS REGULATING THE ACTIVITY OF EXPERT AND LINGUISTIC SUPPORT OF LAWMAKING IN UKRAINE, GERMANY, FRANCE, THE CZECH REPUBLIC, AND POLAND. THE CIRCLE OF THE MAIN EXECUTORS OF EXPERT AND LANGUAGE SUPPORT OF LAWMAKING IN THE SPECIFIED COUNTRIES, FOR THE DEFINITION OF THEIR EFFICIENCY ACCORDING TO THE RULE OF LAW INDEX AS AN INDICATOR OF THE QUALITY OF THE LEGISLATION, IS ALLOCATED. THE NATURE OF THE INFLUENCE OF EXPERT AND LINGUISTIC SUPPORT OF LAWMAKING OF THE ANALYZED STATES AND THEIR RULE OF LAW INDICES IS ESTABLISHED.
90	THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE SCARCE LITERATURE ON GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY BY ANALYSING THE IMPACT OF POLITICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS ON MUNICIPAL FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY. OUR SAMPLE COVERS THE 100 LARGEST SPANISH MUNICIPALITIES IN 2008. COMPULSORY PUBLICITY AND TRANSPARENCY ARE KEY TO PUBLIC MANAGEMENT (RULE-OF-LAW THEORY). OUR DATA SHOW THAT SPANISH MUNICIPALITIES ARE PROVIDING FINANCIAL INFORMATION BEYOND THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, THUS EXCEEDING THE COMPULSORY DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY THE RULE-OF-LAW THEORY. THE MORE TAXES AND MORE TRANSFERS PER CAPITA, THE MORE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS DISCLOSED AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE HIGHER THE TRANSPARENCY IS. THEREFORE THE MUNICIPALITIES ARE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF FISCAL ILLUSION OR PRINCIPAL-AGENT EFFECTS, SINCE THEY ARE NOT CONCEALING HIGHER LEVELS OF TAXES AND TRANSFERS FROM CITIZENS. FURTHERMORE, LEFT-WING PARTIES ARE MORE TRANSPARENT THAN RIGHT-WING ONES. FINALLY, THE POPULATION ALSO HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY.
91	SINCE REFORM AND OPENING UP, THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHINESE JURISPRUDENCE HAS EXPERIENCED A TORTUOUS COURSE, THE EXPLORATION OF WHICH IS DIVIDED INTO THREE STAGES: THE ENTANGLEMENT OF CLASS NATURE, THE DUAL ROLE OF WESTERN JURISPRUDENCE, AND THE RETURN OF CHINESE JURISPRUDENCE. THE AUTHOR PROPOSES A SERIES OF TOPICS IN EIGHT FIELDS, NAMELY, THE CHANGES OF THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL THOUGHTS OF THE LEADERS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA, SOCIALIST JURISPRUDENCE WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS, THEORY OF THE RULE OF LAW, STUDY OF SOCIOLOGY OF LAW, STUDY OF COMPARATIVE LAW, STUDY OF LAW AND GLOBALIZATION, THEORY OF LEGISLATION, AND EVALUATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. SOME OF THESE TOPICS HAVE ALREADY BEEN SOLVED. FOR OTHERS, ONLY THE BASIC FRAMEWORK FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN PROPOSED. EVEN FOR THE SOLVED PROBLEMS, DUE TO SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGES, THE SOLUTIONS WILL NEED TO BE RE-PROPOSED. CHINESE JURISPRUDENCE SHOULD FACE CHINA'S PROBLEMS.
92	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW THE CONCEPT OF 'LAW' IS CULTURALLY DEFINED THROUGH A SEMIOTIC ANALYSIS OF SOME OF THE WAYS IN WHICH LAW IS CONSTRUCTED IN POPULAR CULTURE. THE ARTICLE GOES ON TO MAP THE CHANGING SIGNIFIER OF LAW ACROSS A NUMBER OF FILM AND TELEVISION SERIES, FROM THE HEROIC LAWYER TO THE EMBODIMENT OF THE 'STATE', THE POLICE OFFICER AND THE GOVERNMENT AGENT. IN EACH CASE, ANALYSIS IS PROVIDED OF HOW THE CHANGE IN SIGNIFIER ALTERS THE CORRESPONDING SIGNIFIED OF 'LAW' - AND THE IMPLICATIONS THIS CHANGE HAS FOR THE PURSUIT OF JUSTICE AND FIDELITY TO THE RULE OF LAW. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE POPULAR CULTURAL SIGNIFIER OF LAW HAS SLID FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM THE MODERN RULE OF LAW TOWARDS AN INCREASINGLY TRANSCENDENT AND INTERVENTIONIST PURSUIT OF JUSTICE, PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES AND PROMOTING DEBATE OVER WHAT LAW CAN AND SHOULD BE.
93	THIS PAPER DISCUSSES TWO OF THE MAIN THEORIES REGARDING THE RIGHT TO RESISTANCE: FIRST, THAT THE RIGHT TO RESISTANCE IS THAT OF RESISTANCE AGAINST INJUSTICE; AND SECONDLY, THAT THE RIGHT TO RESISTANCE IS THE ORIGINAL, OR MOST BASIC OF ALL RIGHTS. THE ANALYSIS PROVIDES A CHARACTERIZATION OF THE NATURE OF THE RIGHT TO RESISTANCE, THAT IS, WHETHER IT IS A MORAL RIGHT OR A PROPERLY LEGAL RIGHT. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE RAISE THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THE RIGHT TO RESISTANCE CAN EVEN BE CONSIDERED A FUNDAMENTAL AND/OR ORIGINAL RIGHT. WE ALSO LOOK AT THE ROLE OF THIS RIGHT IN A LAWLESS STATE AS OPPOSED TO A STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW. THUS, THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH AN EXAMINATION OF THE CONCEPTION OF RESISTANCE IN A STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW, BY MEANS OF A SMALL-COIN RIGHT OF RESISTANCE.
94	IN SUMMER 2004, AN UN-SPONSORED INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW COMMISSION BASED ON AN INITIATIVE OF THE GUATEMALAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMUNITY WAS REJECTED BY GUATEMALAN POLITICAL ELITES. IN 2007, A NEW VERSION, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION AGAINST IMPUNITY (CICIG), WAS APPROVED BY THE GUATEMALAN CONGRESS AND HAS SINCE BEEN ACTIVE IN THE COUNTRY, SUPPORTING THE MODERNISATION OF THE GUATEMALAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND THE INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF CRIMINAL NETWORKS. THE CICIG HAS BEEN HAILED AS PART OF A NEW GENERATION OF RULE OF LAW PROMOTION THAT ADDRESSES THE PROBLEMS OF POST-CONFLICT STATES. HOW DID THIS CHANGE IN ELITE SUPPORT COME ABOUT? NEITHER INCREASED PRESSURE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY NOR CHANGES IN THE ELITE GROUPS IN POWER CAN FULLY EXPLAIN THIS SHIFT. RATHER, GUATEMALAN ELITES ACTIVELY RESHAPED THE COMMISSION; IN ADDITION, THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMUNITY REFRAMED IT TO BETTER FIT THE RISK PERCEPTIONS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC.
95	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES MASS ATTITUDES TOWARD UNILATERAL PRESIDENTIAL POWER. WE ARGUE THAT MASS ATTITUDES TOWARD PRESIDENTIAL POWER REFLECT EVALUATIONS OF THE CURRENT PRESIDENT AS WELL AS MORE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE OFFICE, WHICH ARE ROOTED IN BELIEFS ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW. IN FOUR NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEYS, WE FIND LOW LEVELS OF SUPPORT FOR UNILATERAL POWERS, THAT THESE ATTITUDES ARE STABLE OVER TIME, AND THAT THEY ARE STRUCTURED BOTH BY PRESIDENTIAL APPROVAL AND BELIEFS IN THE RULE OF LAW. IN A FIFTH SURVEY, WE SHOW THAT POLITICAL CONTEXT CONDITIONS SUPPORT FOR UNILATERAL POWER, AND IN A SIXTH WE SHOW THAT THESE ATTITUDES ARE CONSEQUENTIAL FOR POLICY EVALUATION. EVEN DURING THE OBAMA PRESIDENCY, WHEN PRESIDENTIAL POWER IS HIGHLY POLITICIZED, VOTERS DISTINGUISH THE PRESIDENT FROM THE PRESIDENCY. OUR RESULTS HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC OPINION'S ROLE IN CONSTRAINING THE USE OF PRESIDENTIAL POWER.
96	WHAT HAPPENS TO THE ORGANISATION AND ACTIVITY OF PUBLIC POLICING WHEN THE INSTITUTIONS AND PROCESSES ON WHICH IT IS SEEMINGLY PREDICATED FOR EXISTENCE AND OPPORTUNITY FRAGMENT? THIS ARTICLE USES THE EXPERIENCE OF A PARADIGMATICALLY WEAK POLICE FORCE - IN THIS CASE, MOGADISHU'S SOMALI POLICE FORCE (SPF) - TO QUESTION TWO ASPECTS OF POLICE STUDIES ORTHODOXY: THAT (1) POLICE WORK IS DEPENDENT ON A POLICE INSTITUTION AND (2) DISCIPLINE AND FORMALITY ARE KEY TO STRUCTURING AND UNDERSTANDING EVERYDAY POLICE WORK. THE SPF'S RECORD SHOWS THAT THE CRITICAL VARIABLES AFFECTING POLICE WORK ARE SECURITY LEVELS, LEGACY ISSUES AND FUNCTIONAL SKILLS, RATHER THAN INSTITUTIONAL RESOURCES, DISCIPLINE OR FORMALITY. INSTITUTIONAL RESOURCES ARE DESIRABLE, BUT DO NOT NECESSARILY PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN INFLUENCING, CO-ORDINATING OR REGULATING OFFICERS' BEHAVIOUR OR GOALS, WHILE THE DISCIPLINE AND FORMALITY ASSOCIATED WITH RANKS AND UNIFORMS ARE OPTIONAL, RATHER THAN ESSENTIAL. THE SPF'S EXPERIENCE IS EXTREME, YET THE INSIGHT IT OFFERS INTO THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF INSTITUTIONAL RESOURCES, HIERARCHY AND DISCIPLINE FOR EVERYDAY POLICE WORK HAS ANALYTICAL AND EMPIRICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICE STUDIES MORE BROADLY.
97	THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE HUNGARIAN CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE EMERGENCY MODEL WHICH CAN BE CALLED AN 'AUTOCRATIC' EMERGENCY MODEL IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT'S MAIN AIM IS TO CREATE AN EMERGENCY REGIME WITHOUT REAL THREAT. THAT WAS THE CASE IN HUNGARY BEFORE 2020, BUT AS THE NEW CORONAVIRUS FLOURISHED THE HUNGARIAN CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW WITHERED. AS THE ARTICLE ASSERTS THE DECLARATION OF THE STATE OF DANGER WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE HUMAN EPIDEMIC IS NOT INVOLVED IN THE LISTING OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS HAVE BECOME EVEN MORE COMPLICATED AFTER THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE '`ENABLING ACT" WHICH GAVE UNCONSTRAINED POWER FOR THE GOVERNMENT. THE SPIRIT OF CARL SCHMITT'S THEORY IS AGAIN EMERGED. AS THE CORONAVIRUS AND ITS IMMEDIATE EFFECT NECESSITATED EXTRA-LEGAL MEASURES, THE THRESHOLD BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND EXCEPTIONALISM WAS FADING SWIFTLY AND LEGAL CONSTITUTIONALISM BECAME A PLEASANT MEMORY.
98	THIS PAPER ASSESSES THE CONTRIBUTION OF COUNTRY GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES TO RESOLVING THE UNSETTLED CROWDING-IN-CROWDING-OUT HYPOTHESIS OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENTS AND ARRESTING THE RECENT FALL OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA). WITHIN AN ARELLANO-BOND DYNAMIC PANEL FRAMEWORK, WE ESTIMATE A DERIVED ACCELERATOR MODEL THAT ALLOWS FOR INCLUSION OF COUNTRY GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES (CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, POLITICAL STABILITY, RULE OF LAW, GOVERNANCE EFFECTIVENESS, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND REGULATORY QUALITY) IN A PUBLIC INVESTMENT MODEL. THE RESULTS, BASED ON DATA FROM SSA, SUGGEST THAT COUNTRY GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES THAT CONTROL CORRUPTION, ENSURE POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW ENHANCE PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN SSA. BUT THE PRESENCE OF THESE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES DOES NOT CURTAIL THE CROWDING OUT EFFECT OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT ON PUBLIC INVESTMENT. THUS, POLICIES DIRECTED AT IMPROVING PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN SSA SHOULD TARGET GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES IN ADDITION TO THE CONVENTIONAL FACTORS.
99	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO DESCRIBE HOW TERRORIST FUNDS ARE RAISED THROUGH CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES AND NATO'S ROLE IN THE INTERNATIONAL FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE PAPER OUTLINES THE MORE GENERAL CONTEXT OF NATO'S OVERALL ROLE IN THE INTERNATIONAL FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM, THE LINK BETWEEN TERRORIST FINANCING AND ORGANISED CRIME AND ISSUES INVOLVED IN CONFRONTING TERRORISM THROUGH THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY. FINDINGS - DEFICIENCIES IN DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT, A WEAK STATE, A LACK OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE ABSENCE OF SOUND ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS CAN BE FERTILE BASES FOR TERRORIST AND CRIMINAL ORGANISATIONS. EVEN IF TERRORISTS CAN FLOURISH IN DEVELOPED SOCIETIES (AND ORGANISED CRIME AS WELL) IT IS A FACT THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE PAPER OFFERS THE OPINION THAT SOUND DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS REMAIN THE BEST ANSWER TO TERROR.
100	THE IDEAL OF HARMONIOUS WORLD IS ROOTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL REFLECTION TO THE REJECTION WEAKNESS OF HUMAN NATURE. BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF HARMONY, PHILOSOPHERS ESTABLISHED THE BASIC FRAMEWORK AND PRINCIPLES OF WORLD OUTLOOK AND HARMONIOUS WORLD GRADUALLY BECOME A SYSTEMATIC VIEW OF THE WORLD. BASED ON THE THEORY OF HARMONIOUS WORLD CONCEPTION, LEGAL SCHOLARS BEGAN TO DESIGN A KIND OF WORLD LAW, THIS KIND OF LEGAL ORDER COLORED WITH A STRONG WESTERN CENTRALISM. WHEN IT LANDED CHINA, A SERIES OF INTERESTING CHEMICAL REACTIONS WAS INVOLVED BOTH IN WORDS AND SYSTEM AND PRESENTED NOT REPLICATED CHINA BACKGROUND. CHINESE LEGAL RESOURCES ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN MERGED INTO THE WESTERN RULE OF LAW CONCEPT, REPRODUCING ITS BONE AND BLOOD, NOT BECAUSE OF VANITY, BUT IN ORDER TO CRITICALLY RETHINK THE UNIVERSALITY OF WESTERN EXPERIENCE AND LAY THE FOUNDATION OF LEGITIMACY FOR CHINA'S RULE OF LAW SOLUTION.
101	GRANTING IMMUNITY FROM SUIT TO A FOREIGN STATE OR AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION, DEPRIVES THE PLAINTIFF OF ACCESS TO COURT AND APPEARS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE RULE OF LAW. SINCE THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS JUDGMENT IN WAITE V GERMANY (1999), THE AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE MEANS FOR DISPUTE SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN EMPHASISED IN THE CONTEXT OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION IMMUNITY. HOWEVER IN THE CASE OF FOREIGN STATE IMMUNITY, THIS APPROACH WAS NOT TAKEN BY THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN AL-ADSANI V UNITEDKINGDOM (2001) NOR BY THE HOUSE OF LORDS IN JONES V MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR OF SAUDI ARABIA (2006). LIKEWISE, FOREIGN STATE IMMUNITY WOULD BE GRANTED UNDER THE UN STATE IMMUNITY CONVENTION OF 2004, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE MEANS. THIS CONVENTION, RATHER THAN ENHANCING THE RULE OF LAW, COULD LEAD TO ITS ATTENUATION. THAT SEVERAL OF THESE CASES INVOLVE IMMUNITY IN CASES OF TORTURE SHARPENS THEIR SENSITIVITY.
102	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES FOR AN INTEGRATED, POLITICAL AND PRAGMATIC APPROACH TO JUSTICE AND SECURITY DEVELOPMENT AS ONE OF THE KEY OBJECTIVES OF EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT TO PEACE BUILDING AND STATE BUILDING IN CONFLICT-AFFECTED AND FRAGILE STATES. DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE 1990S SUGGEST THAT DIFFERENT ACTORS AND COMMUNITIES HAVE STARTED TO WORK ON THE SAME ISSUES FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES AND WITH - PERCEIVED - DIFFERENT MANDATES. AS A RESULT, IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE DEBATE ON HOW TO DEAL WITH SECURITY SYSTEM REFORM (SSR), JUSTICE REFORM AND THE RULE OF LAW SEEM SOMEWHAT STUCK IN CONCEPTUAL ARGUMENTS. THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS MOVING AWAY FROM SUCH DEBATES AND INSTEAD TO FOCUS ON WHAT SUCH JUSTICE AND SECURITY ENGAGEMENTS ARE MEANT TO ACHIEVE, FOR WHOM, AND WHICH GENERAL APPROACHES ARE LIKELY TO PROVIDE MOST ADDED VALUE. IT ARGUES THAT RESULTS REQUIRE POLITICAL FOCUS, LONG-TERM PROCESSES AND NEED TO BE IN TUNE WITH LOCAL ELITE INTERESTS - WHILST PURSUING THE AIM OF GRADUALLY HELPING TO IMPROVE DELIVERY OF JUSTICE AND SECURITY AS BASIC SERVICES FOR ALL, TO APPROPRIATE LOCAL STANDARDS. EXTERNAL AND DOMESTIC OBJECTIVES REQUIRE CAREFUL BALANCING, CREATIVE COMPROMISES AND STRONG INCENTIVES. THE ARTICLE ALSO OUTLINES A NUMBER OF RECURRENT CHALLENGES TO EFFECTIVE PROGRAMMING AND SUGGESTS SOME IDEAS FOR IMPROVEMENT TO ACHIEVE BETTER RESULTS AND MORE VALUE FOR MONEY.
103	THE FOUNDING MYTH OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IS THE SOVEREIGN EQUALITY OF ITS MEMBER STATES. HOW, THEN, CAN AND SHOULD IT ACCOMMODATE THE RISE OF ONE POTENTIAL HEGEMON AND THE DECLINE OF ANOTHER? THIS REVIEW ESSAY DISCUSSES AN IMPORTANT NEW BOOK BY CAI CONGYAN, OF XIAMEN UNIVERSITY, THAT TRIES TO RECONCILE AN INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW WITH RISING POWERS IN GENERAL AND THE RISE OF CHINA IN PARTICULAR. THE LARGER THEORETICAL PROJECT IS LESS SUCCESSFUL THAN A MORE IMMEDIATE ONE, WHICH IS DESCRIBING AND EXPLAINING CHINA'S INSTRUMENTALIST APPROACH TO THE RULE OF LAW AT THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS. THOUGH THE TONE OF THE BOOK IS ASSURED AND REASSURING, CAI'S DIPLOMACY AT TIMES LEAVES SOME INTERESTING QUESTIONS UNANSWERED - AND A FEW CRUCIAL ONES UNASKED. IT IS, NONETHELESS, ESSENTIAL READING FOR ANYONE SEEKING TO UNDERSTAND HOW CHINA SEES AND USES INTERNATIONAL NORMS AND INSTITUTIONS.
104	PREVIOUS RESEARCH EXAMINED CHINESE TAX ADMINISTRATION BASED ON THE PERCEPTION OF THE LACK OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE SITUATION OF A LOW RATE OF TAX LITIGATION IN CHINA IS INTERPRETED AS A RESULT OF NON-RULE-BASED ADMINISTRATION. THIS ARTICLE, BY LOOKING AT LARGE ENTERPRISES' TAX ADMINISTRATION IN CHINA, ESTABLISHES THAT THE RELATIVELY HARMONIOUS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TAXPAYERS AND TAX AUTHORITIES IS A RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PREVENTIVE TAX POLICIES, IN PARTICULAR, A COMBINATION OF INCENTIVES, PUNISHMENT AND RESPECTFUL TREATMENT OF TAXPAYERS. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT ALSO ADOPTS NEW LEGAL MEASURES AND CONSTRAINTS TO IMPROVE THE LEGITIMACY AND FAIRNESS OF TAX ADMINISTRATIVE WORK. THIS ARTICLE REFLECTS THE PROGRESS MADE IN CHINA IN PURSUIT OF THE TARGET OF 'GOVERNING THE COUNTRY IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW' (I.E. THE RULE BY LAW) AND INDICATES THE POTENTIAL IN FURTHER DEVELOPING THE RULE OF LAW WITH CHINESE HALLMARKS.
105	ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES PLAY A SUBSTANTIAL ROLE IN THE FORMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NATIONAL POLICY CENTRAL TO THIS ROLE IS THEIR EXERCISE OF DISCRETION. A NORMATIVE CONSENSUS EXISTS THAT SUCH DISCRETION SHOULD BE CONSTRAINED BY ADMINISTRATIVE DEFERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW. THE COURTS OF APPEALS ARE EXPECTED TO INSURE THAT SUCH DISCRETION IS CONSTRAINED. THE ANALYSIS REPORTED BELOW EXAMINES HOW EFFECTIVELY THEY FULFILL THAT EXPECTATION THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT AGENCY SUCCESS IS RELATED TO POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS, WITH AGENCIES BEING SUCCESSFUL WHEN THEIR DECISIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICY PREFERENCES OF THE JUDGES. HOWEVER, VARIABLES THAT CAPTURED ELEMENTS OF THE LEGAL MODEL WERE ALSO RELATED TO SUCCESS. TAKEN TOGETHER, IT APPEARS THAT THE APPEALS COURTS RESPOND TO BOTH LEGAL CONCERNS AND POLITICAL PREFERENCES. THUS, THE COURTS APPEAR TO FULFILL THE EXPECTATION THAT THEY WILL CONSTRAIN THE WORST ABUSES OF DISCRETION BY IMPOSING THE RULE OF LAW.
106	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF WHY IT WAS POSSIBLE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT ON THE NEXT GENERATION EU (NGEU), THE EU'S FISCAL AND POLICY RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, SINCE THE DEAL BREAKS WITH THE NORMS OF NO COMMON DEBT ISSUANCE AND WILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT REDISTRIBUTION ACROSS MEMBER STATES THROUGH GRANTS. BASED ON AN IN-DEPTH CASE STUDY ANALYSIS, WE IDENTIFY THREE MAIN DIMENSIONS OF CONFLICT UNDERLYING THE POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS: THE FISCAL DIMENSION, THE RULE-OF-LAW DIMENSION AND THE POLICY DIMENSION, ESPECIALLY THE CLIMATE AND DIGITALIZATION AGENDAS. VARIOUS COALITIONS OF ACTORS WERE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE ON THESE ASPECTS, KEEPING A BALANCE BETWEEN THEIR MAIN PRIORITIES, BUT ALSO MAKING CONCESSIONS, TO ENABLE AN AGREEMENT. OUR ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT THE FRANCO-GERMAN ALLIANCE HAS BEEN REVIVED, ENABLING THE GRANT INSTRUMENT IN THE NGEU TO BE ADOPTED; A NEW ALLIANCE OF SMALL RICH NORTHERN STATES NAMED THE FRUGALS' HAS EMERGED AS A SURPRISINGLY STRONG COALITION, INSISTING ON CONDITIONALITY FOR ACCESSING THE GRANT; A CLEAR POLISH-HUNGARIAN FRONT HAS APPEARED TO BE CHALLENGING THE EU'S COMMITMENT TO THE RULE-OF-LAW; AND A WEAKLY COORDINATED SPANISH-ITALIAN FRONT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS OF SECURING GRANTS AS AN INSTRUMENT. THE ARTICLE ALSO ASSESSES THAT DESPITE THE AGREEMENT ON THE DEAL, THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE BATTLES IN THE NGEU, ESPECIALLY ON THE FISCAL AND RULE-OF-LAW DIMENSIONS. YET, IT COULD REPRESENT A 'HAMILTONIAN MOMENT,' IF THE NGEU BECOMES A PERMANENT FISCAL INSTRUMENT, WHICH WOULD ADVANCE EUROPEAN INTEGRATION FURTHER.
107	POVERTY CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST DIFFICULTIES CONFRONTING HUMANITY TODAY, AND ERADICATING POVERTY HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TASKS FACING DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IN THEIR DRIVE FOR LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT. ACCORDINGLY, THIS STUDY ASSESSES THE MODERATING ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY (MEASURED BY RULE OF LAW, REG-ULATION QUALITY, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNT-ABILITY) IN THE FINANCE-POVERTY NEXUS FOR A SAMPLE OF 16 WEST AFRICAN COUNTRIES SPANNING 2002-2019. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT FINANCE (REPRESENTED BY DOMESTIC CREDIT, AND MONEY SUPPLY) REDUCES POVERTY; HOWEVER, THE WEAK INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY REDUCES THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF FINANCE ON POVERTY REDUCTION. THE STUDY ESTABLISHES THAT THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY THRESHOLDS AT WHICH DOMESTIC CREDIT COULD REDUCE POVERTY ARE: RULE OF LAW (0.6), REG-ULATION QUALITY (0.1), CONTROL OF CORRUPTION (1.6), GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS (0.1), AND POLITICAL STABILITY (0.3) ON THE SCALE OF -2.5-2.5. FINALLY, THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY THRESHOLDS AT WHICH MONEY SUPPLY COULD REDUCE POVERTY ARE: RULE OF LAW (2.5), REGULATION QUALITY (0.3), CONTROL OF CORRUPTION (2.0), GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS (1.5), AND POLITICAL STABILITY (1.4) ON THE SCALE OF -2.5-2.5, WHILST THE INTERACTION EFFECT OF DOMESTIC CREDIT, MONEY SUPPLY, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY WERE INSIGNIFICANT. THE STUDY CONCLUDES THAT POLICYMAKERS MUST ENHANCE THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT IN WEST AFRICA TO BOOST FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT TO REDUCE POVERTY.(C) 2022 THE SOCIETY FOR POLICY MODELING.

108	THIS STUDY RE-EXAMINES THE OIL AND DEMOCRACY NEXUS, WHICH IS CENTRAL TO THE POLITICAL RESOURCE CURSE BY APPLYING THE LATEST DEMOCRACY DATASET, V-DEM, INTO THE ANALYSIS IN A SAMPLE OF 100 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, OVER THE PERIOD 1935-2014. OUR STUDY IS A CONTRIBUTION TO THIS TAXONOMIC LITERATURE WHERE WE IMPROVE ON PREVIOUS STUDIES NOT ONLY BY EMPLOYING A NOVEL DEMOCRATIC DATA SOURCE, BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE USE TWO DEFINITIONS OF OIL WEALTH WHICH RENDERS OUR RESULTS MORE ROBUST, BESIDES DELINEATING THE SAMPLE INTO SMALL AND LARGE OIL ENDOWMENTS AND LOOKING INTO THE EXPERIENCE OF TWO REGIONS, LATIN AMERICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST. OUR ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTS NUANCES IN THE OIL-DEMOCRACY RELATIONSHIP. FIRST, THAT THERE IS PRIMA FACIE EVIDENCE FOR A POLITICAL RESOURCE CURSE IF WE DO NOT CONTROL FOR PRE-EXISTING INSTITUTIONS THAT PROMOTE DEMOCRACY. SECOND, ONCE WE DECOMPOSE THE SAMPLE INTO SMALL AND LARGE OIL ENDOWMENTS, THE POLITICAL RESOURCE CURSE VANISHES, AND ALSO FOR LATIN AMERICA, WHILST FOR OIL DEPENDENT ECONOMIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA IT STILL REMAINS. THIRD, AFTER CONTROLLING FOR PRE-EXISTING INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, MEASURED IN OUR CASE BY THE RULE OF LAW, CHANCES OF THE POLITICAL RESOURCE CURSE SEEM TO DIMINISH. WE ALSO CALCULATE THRESHOLD LEVELS FOR THE QUALITY OF THE RULE OF LAW TO BE AT IN SOCIETY BEFORE THEY TURN A CURSE INTO A BLESSING. THE CONVERSE IS EQUALLY TRUE, A DETERIORATION IN THE QUALITY AND PERVASIVENESS OF THE RULE OF LAW WILL CAUSE THE POLITICAL RESOURCE CURSE TO REAPPEAR, AND DEMOCRATIC QUALITY WILL DECLINE.
109	THE ARGUMENT IS PRESENTED THAT THE STATE'S USE OF THE OVERRIDE (S.33) CLAUSE IN THE CANADIAN CHARTER TO INFRINGE CERTAIN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS IS CONSTITUTIONAL ONLY WHEN IN ACCORD WITH S.1 (WHERE IT CAN 'BE DEMONSTRABLY JUSTIFIED IN A FREE AND DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY'). THE ARGUMENT IS SUPPORTED BY TEXTUAL ANALYSIS OF THE CHARTER AND REFERENCE TO THE INTENT OF THE FRAMERS THAT S.33 BE USED TO PROTECT DEMOCRACY. THE CHARTER THUS INTEGRATES HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW SO AS TO MAKE THEM INSEPARABLE. THE 'RULE OF LAW' REQUIRES THAT THE COURTS BE A CHECK ON THE LEGISLATURE AND NOT VICE VERSA. ONLY THEN WILL THE VALUES AND GUARANTEES ENSHRINED IN THE CHARTER BE PROTECTED AND ENFORCED FOR THE BENEFIT OF EVERY MEMBER OF CANADIAN SOCIETY AS THEY MUST BE IF THE STATE IS TO MEET THE INTERNATIONAL LAW CRITERIA FOR A DEMOCRATIC STATE.
110	RULE OF LAW AND THE LEGALITY PRINCIPLE - LEGALITY PRINCIPLE IN THE ITALIAN LEGAL SYSTEM - 'PRESCRIBED BY LAW' - LEGALITY IN SUPRANATIONAL DIMENSION - 'DEMOCRATIC DISCONNECT' - MARGIN OF APPRECIATION - CONCEPTS OF 'LAW' AND 'LEGISLATION' DEMOCRACY-BASED LEGISLATION - QUALITY OF LEGISLATION - 'POLITICAL CONSTITUTIONALISM' VERSUS 'LEGAL CONSTITUTIONALISM'
111	ALTHOUGH POPULAR SETTLEMENTS IN THE CITIES OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES EXIST WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY OUTSIDE OF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF THE STATE, THEY MUST NONETHELESS FOLLOW SOME SORT OF RULE OF LAW. IN THE CASE OF QUASI-LEGAL OR INFORMAL LAND OWNERSHIP CLAIMS, THE SALE AND TRANSFER OF LAND RIGHTS MUST BE GUARANTEED IN ORDER FOR A LAND MARKET TO EXIST. TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THIS ''RULE OF LAW OUTSIDE THE LAW,'' IT IS IMPORTANT TO INQUIRE AS TO THE SOURCE OF LEGAL AUTHORITY IN WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY AN EXTRALEGAL SITUATION. AN EXAMINATION OF THE LITERATURE ON THE SUBJECT SHOWS THAT, IN THE CASE OF URBAN RESIDENTIAL LAND MARKETS, THREE TYPES OF EXTRALEGAL AUTHORITY MAY BE DISCERNED IN PRACTICE. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE CASE OF LAND REGULATION IN JAKARTA, INDONESIA, IN TERMS OF THESE MODELS AND STRESSES THE VALUE OF THIS TYPE OF ANALYSIS IN THE SETTING OF POLICIES FOR LAND REGULARIZATION.
112	IN THIS ARTICLE, WE EXAMINE THE COLONIAL EXPERIENCES OF EIGHT FORMERLY BRITISH-CONTROLLED TERRITORIES BARBADOS, JAMAICA, BOTSWANA, NIGERIA, KENYA, INDIA, BURMA, AND SINGAPORE TO IDENTIFY HOW THE PROCESSES AND POLICIES OF THE COLONIAL ENTERPRISE AFFECTED THEIR RESPECTIVE CONTEMPORARY RULE OF LAW OUTCOMES. WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THE LEGAL ORIGINS THESIS THAT THE BRITISH TRANSPLANTATION OF THE COMMON LAW TO ITS COLONIAL TERRITORIES CONFERRED UPON SUCH RECIPIENT SOCIETIES THE INSTITUTIONAL TOOLS NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT TO PROMOTE THE SUBSEQUENT ACHIEVEMENT OF STRONG DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES, WE NOTE THE DIVERSITY OF MODERN RULE OF LAW INDICATORS AMONG FORMER BRITISH COLONIES AND QUESTION WHAT HERETOFORE UNEXPLORED DYNAMICS OF THE COLONIAL INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT MAY EXPLAIN SUCH DIVERGENT RESULTS. BASED UPON OUR INVESTIGATIONS OF THE VARIOUS GOVERNANCE MODELS EMPLOYED BY THE BRITISH, AND, MORE SIGNIFICANTLY, THE DEGREE OF RESPONSIVENESS TO CITIZEN NEEDS SUCH INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS PROVIDED, WE IDENTIFY TWO FEATURES OF COLONIAL ADMINISTRATION AND LEGAL TRANSPLANTATION WHOSE ANECDOTAL SIGNIFICANCE SUGGESTS TO US SOME THEORETICAL IMPORTANCE FOR THESE FACTORS IN THE PROMOTION OF A LONG-RUN, STABLE COMMITMENT TO LEGALITY IN THESE COUNTRIES (OR LACK THEREOF): (1) THE DEGREE OF REPRESENTATION IN LEGISLATIVE BODIES AFFORDED TO THE INDIGENOUS POPULATION; AND (2) THE EXTENT TO WHICH INDIGENOUS AND BRITISH COMMON LAW COURTS AND ANIMATING VALUES WERE INTEGRATED, FOSTERING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LOCALIZED COMMON LAW JURISPRUDENCE. IN THIS WAY, WE NOT ONLY SEEK TO EXPLAIN HOW THE COLONIAL EXPERIENCE INFLUENCED SUBSEQUENT RULE OF LAW OUTCOMES IN THESE EIGHT COUNTRIES, BUT ALSO TO EMPLOY THE LESSONS OF THE PAST TO INFORM OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE DYNAMICS OF INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT, PARTICULARLY IN THE LEGAL ARENA.
113	THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO ILLUMINATE THE USE OF EXCEPTIONAL NATIONAL SECURITY AND EMERGENCY POWERS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM IN TURKEY. THE ARTICLE IS ORGANIZED IN FOUR PARTS. SECTION I LOOKS AT THE ROLE OF TERRORISM IN THE ACTIVATION AND JUSTIFICATION OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND INTRODUCES THE TURKISH CASE WITHIN THIS CONTEXT. SECTION II EXPLORES THE HISTORICAL ORIGINS OF THE TURKISH STATE OF EMERGENCY REGIME AND ANALYSES THE PRINCIPLES REGULATING EMERGENCY REGIME AT THE TURKISH DOMESTIC LEVEL. SECTION III EXAMINES THE OPERATION OF GOVERNMENTAL EMERGENCY POWERS BY PROVIDING AN ANALYSIS OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY PRACTICES IN TURKEY, BOTH PAST AND PRESENT. A PRINCIPAL FOCUS IS NECESSARILY DIRECTED AT THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND THE MEASURES DEPLOYED WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK IN TURKEY'S PREDOMINANTLY KURDISH SOUTHEAST, WHERE EMERGENCY RULE WAS IN FORCE FROM 1987 TO 2002, AND THE RECENT NATIONWIDE STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE WAKE OF THE 15 JULY ATTEMPTED COUP. SECTION IV PRESENTS CONCLUDING REMARKS.
114	THE ARTICLE ANALYZES TEXTS FROM THE LEADING HEBREW WEEKLIES FOR CHILDREN DURING ISRAEL'S FIRST DECADE AND SHOWS HOW JOURNALISM OF THIS KIND DEVELOPED AS A MEANINGFUL PLATFORM FOR LEGAL AND MORAL ISSUES. IT ADDRESSES THE CONCERN OF CHILDREN'S JOURNALS WITH THE LAWS OF THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED STATE OF ISRAEL AND CURRENT AND JUDICIAL MATTERS IN GENERAL. AN EXCEPTION TO THIS PREOCCUPATION WITH THE RULE OF LAW WAS THE COVERAGE OF THE IDF'S ACT OF RETRIBUTION IN THE VILLAGE OF QIBYA IN JORDAN (1953), IN WHICH DOZENS OF INNOCENT CITIZENS, INCLUDING WOMEN AND CHILDREN, WERE KILLED AND INJURED. THE ARTICLE TAKES A CRITICAL LOOK AT THE DEPICTION OF THIS ACT IN CERTAIN WEEKLIES FOR YOUNG READERS AS LEGITIMATE RETRIBUTIVISM BY ISRAELI CITIZENS BEYOND STATE LINES AND DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN THE INTENTION TO PROMOTE LEGAL AWARENESS AND NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE EFFORT TO MEDIATE MORAL-CONSCIENTIOUSNESS AND RULE-OF-LAW VALUES.
115	BUILDING STRONG CAPACITIES IN PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY IS KEY TO CONTROLLING MALFEASANCE IN PUBLIC EXPENDITURE. EVEN THOUGH MOST PUBLIC ENTITIES IN MOST COUNTRIES ARE LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO REPORT ON PUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND TO DETECT INCIDENCES OF MALFEASANCE, DIFFERING GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS REGARDING POLITICAL DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW AND CIVIL LIBERTIES INDICATE DIFFERENCES IN THE PRIORITY GIVEN TO, AND IN THE RESULTS OBTAINED THROUGH, PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THOSE OF THE SUPREME AUDIT INSTITUTIONS (SAIS). THIS ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES HOW VARIATIONS IN GOVERNANCE ENABLERS IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE WORLD PRODUCE DIFFERING RESULTS. IT ARGUES THAT ON THEIR OWN AND WITHOUT NECESSARY INVESTMENTS IN DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, INVESTMENTS IN ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES, INCLUDING THOSE OF THE SAIS, WILL NOT PRODUCE DESIRED OUTCOMES AND THUS WILL HAVE LITTLE OR NO IMPACT ON THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. IT ALSO CITES SELECTED SUCCESSFUL CASES OF CIVIL SOCIETY PARTICIPATION IN THE AUDITING OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAMMES.
116	THE ARTICLE EXAMINES "REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS" AS A SUBJECT OF STATE CONTROL OVER BUSINESS IN RUSSIA. THE AUTHOR DELIBERATELY DOES NOT USE THE TERM "THE RULE OF LAW". THE ARTICLE STATES THAT A SET OF REQUIREMENTS FOR BUSINESS IS WIDER THAN THE LEGISLATIVE REGULATION. FIRST, THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE REGULATORY NATURE OF THE REQUIREMENTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE TECHNICAL FIELD. THE REQUIREMENTS ARE CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE EXPLORES APPROACHES TO THE DEFINITION OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IN RUSSIAN LEGAL SCIENCE. THE AUTHOR ANALYZES LEGISLATION DEFINITIONS FOR A SET OF REQUIREMENTS FOR BUSINESS. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT ALWAYS IDENTICAL TO THE RULE OF LAW. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE A SET OF OBLIGATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR ENTREPRENEURS' ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. VALIDATION FAILURE LEADS TO NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. SECOND, THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE PROBLEMS OF THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IN PRACTICE. LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE REQUIREMENTS, THEIR IRRELEVANCE AND INCONSISTENCY ARE PROBLEMS OF THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IN RUSSIA. MANY REQUIREMENTS REGULATING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE CURRENT DEVELOPMENT LEVEL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. THE PROBLEMS ARE ANALYZED ON THE BASIS OF THE RUSSIAN JUDICIAL PRACTICE AND ANNUAL MONITORING REPORTS BY HIGHER SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS. FINALLY, THE AUTHOR PROVIDES AN APPROACH TO THE POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS' PROBLEM. THE AUTHOR PROPOSES TO CREATE A NATIONWIDE INTERNET PORTAL ABOUT REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE PORTAL SHOULD CONTAIN FULL INFORMATION ABOUT ALL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE AUTHOR RECOMMENDS EXTENDING MORATORIUM ON THE USE OF THE REQUIREMENTS ADOPTED BY THE BODIES AND ORGANIZATIONS OF THE FORMER USSR GOVERNMENT.
117	THE ARTICLE IS DEDICATED TO THE ACTIVITY OF OSCE IN THE SPHERE OF FIGHTING TERRORISM. THERE IS A CONCLUSION THAT THE INTERNATIONAL MEASURES FOR COMBATING TERRORISM SHOULD BE TAKEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS.
118	THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE AND THE UNITED NATIONS BLACKLISTING REGIME BACKGROUND, CASE-LAW AND CONFLICT IN RELATION TO THAT REGIME - THE KADI II CASE - WIDER CONSTITUTIONAL DIMENSIONS OF THE RULING - THEORETICAL ASPECTS OF THE DISPUTE FROM RULE OF LAW PERSPECTIVE - THE FUTURE
119	LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE MOTIVES OF LAWYERS WHO PROVIDE FREE LEGAL ASSISTANCE IN COUNTRIES THAT LACK BOTH A DEVELOPED PROFESSIONAL COMMUNITY AND DEVELOPED INSTITUTIONS RELATED TO THE RULE OF LAW. BASED ON A SURVEY OF 3,317 CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYERS (ADVOKATY) IN 35 REGIONS OF RUSSIA, WE ANALYZE THE PROVISION OF TWO TYPES OF FREE LEGAL SERVICES: PARTICIPATION IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS "ON APPOINTMENT" (PO NAZNACHENIYU) AND THE PROVISION OF PRO BONO LEGAL ASSISTANCE. WE SHOW THAT WORK ON APPOINTMENT USUALLY INVOLVES LAWYERS WITH LOW SOCIAL CAPITAL AND A LACK OF REGULAR CLIENTS. IN CONTRAST, PRO BONO LEGAL ASSISTANCE IS ENCOURAGED BY LAWYERS' ORGANIZATIONS. IT IS TYPICALLY PROVIDED BY PROFESSIONALS WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF SOCIAL CAPITAL AND WITH VALUES AIMED AT MAINTAINING AN EXCELLENT PROFESSIONAL REPUTATION. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE PROVISION OF FREE LEGAL SERVICES MIGHT BEST BE STIMULATED WITHIN THE PROFESSIONAL COMMUNITY RATHER THAN BY THE GOVERNMENT.
120	A MAJOR CHALLENGE THE RULE OF LAW MUST FACE UP IS TO RECONCILE HUMAN RIGHTS AND LEGAL PATERNALISM. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES SOME CLUES FOR UNDERLYING THE COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN THEM, LEGITIMIZING STATE INTERFERENCES ON PEOPLE'S LIFE WHEN BEHAVIOUR DO NOT HARM TO OTHERS.
121	THIS ARTICLE OFFERS AN EXPLANATION FOR WHY THE ARTICLE 7 (1) PROCEDURES, THE SO-CALLED PREVENTIVE MECHANISM, TRIGGERED AGAINST POLAND AND HUNGARY OVER BREACHES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION'S FUNDAMENTAL VALUES HAVE NOT MADE ANY PROGRESS AND HAVE COME TO A STANDSTILL. DRAWING ON THE INCOMPLETE CONTRACTING APPROACH, IT IS ARGUED THAT THE COUNCIL, WHICH IS CHARGED WITH CARRYING OUT THE PROCEDURES, HAS BEEN ABLE TO WATER THESE PROCEDURES DOWN BY FILLING THE INCOMPLETE PROVISION OF ARTICLE 7 (1) WITH ITS OWN PROCEDURAL RULES. THE 'OFFENDER-FRIENDLY' RULES ESTABLISHED BY THE COUNCIL HAVE ENABLED IT TO CONTROL AND DELAY THE PROCESSES. MOREOVER, IT IS ARGUED THAT THESE RULES WERE ESSENTIAL FOR THE COUNCIL TO SOLVE ITS 'ARTICLE 7 DILEMMA'. THE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ALLEGED 'NUCLEAR OPTION' IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE COUNCIL'S PROCEDURAL RULES.
122	NATIONAL SOCIALISM OPERATED A LEGAL REVOLUTION THAT AFFECTED ALL THE BASES OF THE LAW ESTABLISHED SO FAR. CRIMINAL LAW BECAME A VEHICLE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A POLICE STATE THAT CARRIED OUT A RACIAL WAR OF EXTERMINATION AGAINST ENTIRE CATEGORIES OF HUMAN BEINGS. THROUGH THIS STUDY WE ANALYZED WHAT THIS REVOLUTION CONSISTED OF AND WHAT FINAL FORM ADOPTED THIS NEW CRIMINAL LAW.
123	THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE CHALLENGES OF INTEGRATING AN ECONOMICALLY POWERFUL STATE IN THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER (HEREINAFTER "IEO"). AS SUCH IT IDENTIFIES THE PROCESS OF THE AMERICANIZATION OF THE IEO FOCUSING FIRSTLY ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECONOMIC POWER AND THE RULE OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW IN THE CONTEXT OF DECISION-MAKING IN INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS AND ADJUDICATIVE DECISIONS IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE. SECONDLY, IT FOCUSSES ON THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT A STATE HAS AND/OR SHOULD HAVE IN THE ENGAGEMENT OF TRADE WARS.
124	THE ROAD TO THE DEVELOPING CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) CULMINATED IN THE FORMAL IDENTIFICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES ENSHRINED IN FORMER ARTICLE 6 TEU AS FOUNDING VALUES, FIRST IN TERMS OF ARTICLE I-2 OF THE DEFUNCT TREATY ESTABLISHING A CONSTITUTION FOR EUROPE AND EVENTUALLY IN ARTICLE 2 TEU, AS INTRODUCED BY THE LISBON TREATY. MOVING FROM THIS ASSUMPTION, THE RESEARCH IS AIMED AT INVESTIGATING THE SCOPE OF NEW ARTICLE 2 TEU FROM A CASE LAW PERSPECTIVE, PAYING ATTENTION TO THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE EU COURT OF JUSTICE TO THE DEFINITION OF EACH VALUE. FIRST OF ALL, IT WILL BE UNDERSCORED THAT, UNLIKE THE PREVIOUS WORDING, THE NEW PROVISION CLARIFIES AND DEEPENS THE CATALOGUE OF FUNDAMENTAL VALUES, ADDING A REFERENCE TO HUMAN DIGNITY AND EQUALITY AND INSERTING A SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO THE RIGHTS OF PERSONS BELONGING TO MINORITIES. SECONDLY, IT WILL BE ARGUED THAT, ALTHOUGH A PRECISE DEFINITION OF EACH FOUNDING VALUE IS NOT EASY, A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THEIR INTERPRETATION MAY BE FOUND IN THE CASE LAW ISSUED BY THE EU COURT OF JUSTICE, WHICH ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS MADE REFERENCE TO THE VALUES OF THE EU.
125	THE RECENT APPROVAL OF THE LOMLOE HAS LED TO AN INTENSE DEBATE ON ITS CONTENT AND, VERY SIGNIFICANTLY, ON THOSE ASPECTS OF THE ORGANIC LEGISLATIVE TEXT THAT ARE MOST CONTROVERSIAL FROM A CONSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE. BEYOND THE CONTROVERSY GENERATED AROUND ITS UNIQUE PROCESSING, PROMOTED WITH GREAT SPEED DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THE RESULT OF A TECHNICALLY QUESTIONABLE LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURE, CRITICISM HAS FOCUSED ON THE LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS RELATED TO CONCERTED EDUCATION, THE PEDAGOGICAL MODEL OF DIFFERENTIATED SCHOOL OR THE CURTAILMENT OF MANAGERIAL POWER WITH RESPECT TO PRIVATE OWNERSHIP. THE STATE ORGANIC TEXT OVERSIZES THE PERFORMANCE ASPECT OF THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION BY DINT OF LIMITING ITS INTRINSIC VALUE OF FREEDOM AND SLIDES US TOWARDS A QUESTIONABLE STATE EDUCATIONAL MODEL THAT NOT ONLY DEPARTS FROM THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONSENSUS BUT CAN SERIOUSLY UNDERMINE THE SYSTEM OF VALUES THAT SUPPORT THE EU. REOPENING, IN SHORT, A CONSTITUTIONAL DEBATE WHOSE RESOLUTION WILL SHED LIGHT ON DETERMINING ASPECTS OF THE SPANISH EDUCATIONAL MODEL, CONDEMNED TO CHRONIC INSTABILITY BY A STATE LEGISLATOR INCAPABLE OF FORGING LASTING CONSENSUS OVER TIME.
126	IN THE ARTICLE THE CONCEPT OF THE SPECIAL PART OF THE RUSSIAN CRIMINAL LAW IS DISCUSSED. THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS THE DEFINITIONS OF THE SPECIAL PART EXISTING IN CRIMINAL LAW, ASSESSES THEM. THE CONCLUSION THAT THE SPECIAL PART OF CRIMINAL LAW IS A SYSTEM FORMATION IS PROVED; ITS CRIMINAL NORMS SECURE MOST SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC RELATIONS. THE AUTHOR STATES THAT RULES OF LAW (NORMS-PROSCRIPTIONS,NORMS-INSTRUCTIONS) AND INSTITUTES - GROUPS OF RULES OF LAW PROVIDING RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMMITTING CERTAIN CRIMES ARE ELEMENTS OF THE SYSTEM OF THE SPECIAL PART. THE GENESIS OF FORMATION OF THE SPECIAL PART OF THE RUSSIAN CRIMINAL LAW IS ANALYZED. THE CONCLUSION IS DRAWN THAT THE SPECIAL PART AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT OF THE TEXT OF THE STATUTORY ACT WAS FIRST ALLOCATED IN BOOK I " ON CRIMES AND PUNISHMENT IN GENERAL" OF VOL. 15 OF THE CODE OF LAWS OF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE OF 1832 (THIS VOLUME WAS CALLED " THE CODE OF CRIMINAL LAWS"). THE CRITERIA OF GROUPING THE CRIMINAL PROSCRIPTIONS FORMING THE SPECIAL PART OF THE RUSSIAN CRIMINAL LAWS IN THE 19TH-20TH CENTURIES ARE GIVEN. THE INTERRELATION OF THE GENERAL AND SPECIAL PARTS OF THE CRIMINAL CODE OF RUSSIAN FEDERATION IS SHOWN, AFFIRMING THAT IN THE SYSTEM OF THE SPECIAL PART OF CRIMINAL LAW THE FOLLOWING CONNECTIONS OPERATE: 1) BETWEEN NORMS OF CRIMINAL LAW AND INSTITUTES OF THE SPECIAL PART OF CRIMINAL LAW; 2) BETWEEN THE INSTITUTES OF THE SPECIAL PART OF CRIMINAL LAW; 3) BETWEEN INSTITUTES OF SPECIAL AND GENERAL PARTS OF CRIMINAL LAW. THE AUTHOR SHOWS INTERRELATION OF NORMS OF THE SPECIAL PART OF CRIMINAL LAW WITH THE NORMS OF OTHER BRANCHES OF LAW ( CONSTITUTIONAL, CIVIL, ADMINISTRATIVE, ETC.) DEFINING THE OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE SIGNS OF DIFFERENT CRIMES. THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS TECHNICAL AND LEGAL TOOLS OF WORDING THE CRIMINAL PROSCRIPTIONS IN THE ARTICLES OF THE SPECIAL PART. HE ASSERTS THAT THE ARTICLES, CHAPTERS AND SECTIONS OF THE CRIMINAL CODE ARE NOT THE ELEMENTS OF THE SYSTEM OF CRIMINAL LAW, BUT REPRESENT TECHNICAL AND LEGAL FRAGMENTS OF A LEGISLATIVE TEXT, ALLOCATION OF THESE PARTS PROVIDES LOGICALLY COORDINATED, RATIONAL, UNIFORM STATEMENT OF THE CONTENT OF NORMS OF CRIMINAL LAW IN THE CRIMINAL CODE OF RUSSIAN FEDERATION.
127	SINCE THE CONCLUSION OF NORTH AFRICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT (NAFTA) IN 1994, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF FOREIGN TRADE AGREEMENTS (FTAS) HAVE INCLUDED LABOUR PROVISIONS ALONG WITH SPECIFIC DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MECHANISMS FOR THESE PROVISIONS. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES HOW LABOUR PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN FTAS' SINCE THE EARLY 1990S AND CRITICALLY ACCESSES THEIR SUITABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS IN TERMS OF DOMESTIC LABOUR REFORM AND TRADE-RELATED LABOUR DISPUTE SETTLEMENT. IT CONCLUDES BY EVALUATING THE CASE FOR THE INCLUSION OF LABOUR PROVISIONS IN FTAS AND ARGUES IN FAVOUR OF TAILOR-MADE RULES SUITED TO THE PRECISE REALITY OF COUNTRIES' LABOUR MARKETS AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT.
128	THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE FORMATION OF CHINESE CONSTITUTIONAL LEGISLATION UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY AND ON THIS BASIS ANALYZES THE ACTIVE ROLE OF THE CCP IN THIS PROCESS. THE AUTHOR STUDIED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHINESE CONSTITUTION AND THE RELATED LEGISLATION. THIS PROCESS HAS GONE THROUGH A THORNY PATH: INCEPTION (1927-1949), FORMATION (1949-1966), STAGNATION (1966-1978), FURTHER DEVELOPMENT (1978-2012), AND FINALLY IMPROVEMENT (2012 - PRESENT). THE MAIN RESEARCH METHODS WERE FORMAL-LEGAL (USED TO STUDY THE TEXTS OF THE LAWS OF CHINA FROM 1927 TO THE PRESENT). THE AUTHOR IDENTIFIED THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF RULE-MAKING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIELD OF PUBLIC LAW IN CHINA. IN THE COURSE OF THE STUDY, THE AUTHOR FOUND THAT THE CREATION OF THE CPC WAS A LANDMARK EVENT IN THE HISTORY OF BOTH THE COUNTRY AND THE WHOLE WORLD IN 1921. IN 2021, THE CPC CELEBRATES ITS CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY. AS THIS DIFFICULT CENTURY HAS SHOWN, COMPREHENSIVE GOVERNANCE OF THE STATE ON A LEGAL BASIS IS A KEY GUARANTEE, ESSENTIAL FOR THE COMMITMENT TO THIS PATH AND FOR ITS DEVELOPMENT, AN INDISPENSABLE CONDITION FOR THE MODERNIZATION OF THE SYSTEM AND THE POTENTIAL OF STATE GOVERNANCE. IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CPC, CHINA TIRELESSLY SOUGHT NEW SOLUTIONS AND INVESTED GREAT EFFORTS IN CREATING A RICH AND STRONG STATE, REVIVING THE CHINESE NATION, AND IMPROVING THE PEOPLE'S WELL-BEING. DURING THE FOUNDING OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, IN THE PERIOD OF REFORM AND OPENNESS THAT FOLLOWED, AND IN THE NEW ERA OF SOCIALISM WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS, THE PARTY PLAYED A KEY, DECISIVE ROLE IN FULFILLING ALL THE TASKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORMATION OF THESE LAWS. AS A RESULT OF THE ANALYSIS, THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT THE PARTY LEADERSHIP, THE PEOPLE AS THE RIGHTFUL OWNER OF THEIR COUNTRY AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE ON THE BASIS OF LAW ARE CLOSELY RELATED TO EACH OTHER AND CONSTITUTE AN ORGANISM CHARACTERIZED BY INTERNAL UNITY. AS THE EXPERIENCE OF CREATING CONSTITUTIONAL LEGISLATION SHOWS, CHINA NEEDS TO ADHERE TO THE ORGANIC UNITY OF THESE THREE ELEMENTS IN PRACTICE. IT IS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM OF IMPLEMENTATION, CONTROL AND GUARANTEE OF LEGAL GOVERNANCE, TO PROTECT THE AUTHORITY OF CONSTITUTIONAL LEGISLATION. IT IS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN AND IMPROVE THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF THE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS, CONTINUOUSLY MODERNIZE THE TECHNIQUE OF LAWMAKING AND IMPROVE ITS QUALITY, AND CONTINUE TO DEEPEN AND DEVELOP SCIENTIFIC AND DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATIVE WORK, RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF CHINA'S OWN CONDITIONS AND NATIONAL SPECIFICS, AND STUDY THE FRUITS AND EXPERIENCE OF CREATING FOREIGN CONSTITUTIONAL LEGISLATION.
129	THE JURISDICTION OF MILITARY COURTS WAS EXTENDED OVER ALLEGED TERRORISTS UNDER THE CONSTITUTION (TWENTY-FIRST AMENDMENT) ACT, 2015, IN ORDER TO PERMANENTLY WIPE OUT TERRORISM FROM PAKISTAN. THE AMENDMENT WAS CHALLENGED AND PETITIONERS CONTENDED THAT JURISDICTION OF MILITARY COURTS COULD NOT BE EXTENDED OVER ALLEGED CIVILIAN TERRORISTS BECAUSE OF THEIR PECULIAR NATURE. FURTHER, THE PRESIDING OFFICER OF THE MILITARY COURT IS A MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE, WHICH CONTRADICTS THE PRINCIPLE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, AN UTMOST ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF SAFEGUARDING THE DUE PROCESS OF LAW. HOWEVER, THE APEX COURT OF PAKISTAN HELD THAT TERRORISM HAS A DIRECT NEXUS WITH THE SAFETY AND INTEGRITY OF PAKISTAN, THEREFORE, THE PARLIAMENT WAS COMPETENT TO EXPAND THE JURISDICTION OF MILITARY COURTS OVER CIVILIAN TERRORISTS IN ORDER TO SECURE THE COUNTRY'S SAFETY AND INTEGRITY AND THUS CONSISTENT WITH THE RECOGNIZED CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THIS RESEARCH CRITICALLY ANALYZES THE JURISDICTION OF MILITARY COURTS OVER CIVILIAN TERRORISTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. IT ALSO IDENTIFIES THE BREACH OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF ALLEGED CIVILIAN TERRORISTS. THIS STUDY ALSO DETERMINES THE CAPABILITY OF EXISTING CRIMINAL LAW STATUTES OF ENSURING PEACE WHILST MAINTAINING JUSTICE FOR THE ACCUSED PERSONS. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, THIS ARTICLE ADOPTS A DOCTRINAL RESEARCH METHOD AND CARRIES OUT AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE AMENDMENTS AND JUDGMENTS RELATING TO THE ISSUE, WHILE ALSO HIGHLIGHTING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE SUBJECT MATTER. ASIDE FROM THAT, JURISTIC LITERATURES AND JUDGMENTS OF THE SUPERIOR COURTS ARE ALSO ANALYSED. THE STUDY CONCLUDES THAT AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL TRIBUNAL IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT JUSTICE IS DISPENSED TO THE ACCUSED. IT IS FURTHER ARGUED THAT THE SCOPE OF THE MILITARY JUSTICE SYSTEM IS LIMITED TO MILITARY PERSONNEL, WHICH THEREFORE CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT BE EXPANDED OVER CIVILIAN TERRORISTS.
130	THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE STATE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE CIVIL SOCIETY OF RUSSIA. THESE RELATIONS ARE TREATED AS PART OF A WIDER COOPERATION BETWEEN THE EU AND RUSSIA, THE LEGAL BASIS OF WHICH IS THE PARTNERSHIP AND COOPERATION AGREEMENT (PCA). THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE FORMS OF COOPERATION AND THE EU PROGRAMMES DESIGNED FOR ORGANIZATIONS OF THE RUSSIAN CIVIL SOCIETY. IT IS POINTED OUT THAT THE EU GIVES A BROAD FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS IN RUSSIA AND IN THE COUNTRIESOF THE POST-SOVIET SPACE. THE ARTICLE PAYS ATTENTION TO THE NATURE AND SCALE OF THESE RELATIONS IN THE FUTURE.
131	NEOLIBERALISM REPRESENTS THE REVIVAL OF ECONOMIC LIBERALISM THAT HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE SINCE THE LATE 1970S. ITS MAIN PREMISE IS THAT THE MARKET IS MORALLY AND PRACTICALLY SUPERIOR TO GOVERNMENT AND ANY FORM OF POLITICAL CONTROL INTENDED TO IMPROVE ON MARKET OUTCOMES. CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES (CEES) WERE GLOBAL LEADERS IN THE ADOPTION OF NEOLIBERAL IDEAS AND POLICIES DURING THE 1990S AND 2000S. ALMOST ALL CEES ADOPTED NEOLIBERAL IDEAS AND POLICIES AT A DRAMATIC RATE AND ARE NOW AMONG THE MOST OPEN ECONOMIES IN EUROPE. THIS WAS PARTICULARLY TRUE DURING THE EARLY TRANSITION PERIOD, WHEN NEOLIBERALISM EMERGED AS A VIRTUALLY UNCHALLENGED IDEOLOGY STRONGLY DOMINATING THE COURSE OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL REFORMS IN THE REGION. CEES LARGELY FOLLOWED THE SCRIPT WRITTEN BY THE AUTHORS OF THE WASHINGTON CONSENSUS AND IMPLEMENTED MONETARY STABILIZATION, ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION, AND A GRAND-SCALE PRIVATIZATION OF THE LARGELY STATE-OWNED ECONOMY. THIS ARTICLE TRACES THE ROLE OF LAW DURING THE FIRST 25 YEARS OF TRANSITION AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH NEOLIBERAL POLICIES AND INSTITUTIONS THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE IN CEES. IT DOES SO CHRONOLOGICALLY, THROUGH THREE DIFFERENT PERIODS OF TRANSITION, WHICH ALSO REPRESENT THE QUITE DIFFERENT ROLES THAT THE LAW ASSUMED IN THE PROCESS.
132	THE UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS ADDRESS A NUMBER OF CRIMINOLOGICAL ISSUES. THIS ARTICLE ACCOUNTS FOR WHY CRIMINOLOGISTS SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THIS AGENDA IN A WAY THAT MIGHT BENEFIT THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY. WE ACKNOWLEDGE A HEIGHTENED RISK OF CRIME IN PARTS OF THE GLOBAL SOUTH BUT ARGUE CRIMINOLOGISTS SHOULD CAUTIOUSLY EMBRACE THIS AGENDA AS A PLATFORM FOR ACHIEVING HUMAN AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES. SUPPORTING THIS AGENDA MEANS ASSISTING WITH THE DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION OF PROJECTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO SAFE, JUST AND SUSTAINABLE SOCIETIES. FROM A CRITICAL STANDPOINT, IT ALSO MEANS CHALLENGING HARMFUL OR INAPPROPRIATE INITIATIVES AND RESISTING ATTEMPTS TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS AGENDA FOR POLITICAL GAIN. BOTH MODES OF ENGAGEMENT ARE INFORMED BY THE VALUES OF 'CAUTION', 'SCEPTICISM' AND SOUTHERN EPISTEMOLOGIES. THE ARTICLE THEN PROCEEDS TO EXAMINE THREE AREAS WHERE CRIMINOLOGICAL RESEARCH CAN MAKE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS: BUILDING SAFE AND JUST SOCIETIES, ELIMINATING GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE AND PROMOTING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE.
133	THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION IN LAW STUDIES IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW. THIS SITUATION IS MORE EVIDENT IN THE FIELD OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE TRAINING. THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION IN THE SAID AREA, DESERVES GENERAL EDUCATIONAL APPROACHES AND SPECIFIC REFERENCE FRAMES.
134	WHILE SOME POLICYMAKERS WANT TO USE US SUPREMACY TO RESIST MULTILATERALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW, THE LESSON OF HISTORY IS THAT EVEN POWERFUL STATES-AND CERTAINLY A UNIPOLAR AMERICA-GAIN ADVANTAGE BY SUPPORTING AND OPERATING WITHIN AN INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF RULES AND INSTITUTIONS.
135	BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY, IT CAN BE ARGUED THAT THE ISSUES OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL ASPECTS OF COURT SERVICES IN UKRAINE ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD AND EXTREMELY RELEVANT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE COUNTRY'S EUROPEAN INTEGRATION PROCESS AND IN THE CONTEXT OF UNCERTAINTY AND INSTABILITY. IT HAS BEEN REVEALED THAT IN UKRAINE THE MECHANISM OF NORMATIVE-LEGAL AND LEGISLATIVE REGULATION OF COURT SERVICES IS TOO WEAK. MOREOVER, THERE IS NO CLEAR AND UNIFIED DEFINITION OF THEIR ESSENCE, WHICH REQUIRES IMPROVEMENT OF THE CURRENT NATIONAL LEGISLATION. IT CAN BE ACHIEVED BY DEVELOPING AND ADOPTING THE LAW OF UKRAINE "ON COURT SERVICES". IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT COURT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED IN COMPLIANCE WITH GENERAL AND SPECIAL PRINCIPLES. HOWEVER, THE AUTHOR NOTES THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN THEIR PROVISION, IN PARTICULAR, THERE IS NO CLEAR SYSTEMATIZATION OF THEIR LIST, THE EXISTING SCIENTIFIC, APPLIED, LEGISLATIVE AND METHODOLOGICAL SUPPORT FOR THE COURT SERVICES PROCEDURE IS IMPERFECT, AND THE QUALITY OF COURT SERVICES DOES NOT MEET INTERNATIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS. THUS, IT HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO INTRODUCE ADMINISTRATIVE LIABILITY FOR VIOLATION OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURE FOR THE PROVISION OF COURT SERVICES, AS WELL AS TO STRENGTHEN INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CONTROL OVER THE QUALITY OF THEIR PROVISION TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS.
136	THIS PAPER ANALYZES REGULATION (EU) 2021/167, WHICH ALLOWS THE EU TO APPLY UNILATERAL TRADE POLICY MEASURES TO WTO MEMBERS THAT DECIDE TO APPEAL A PANEL REPORT THAT IS FAVORABLE TO THE EU BEFORE THE APPELLATE BODY (AB). ITS OBJECTIVE IS TO DETERMINE THEIR LEGALITY IN THE LIGHT OF WTO LAW. SPECIFICALLY, WE ASK HOW A WTO PANEL WOULD REACT TO THE EU'S ARGUMENT THAT A WTO MEMBER'S FILING OF A NULL AND VOID APPEAL WITH AN AB, WHOSE CURRENT EXISTENCE IS MERELY NOMINAL, IS AN ACT OF BAD FAITH. TO THIS END, FIRSTLY, THE CONTEXT THAT LED TO THE ADOPTION OF THIS REGULATION IS ANALYZED. SECONDLY, THE EXTENT TO WHICH GENERAL INTERNATIONAL LAW CAN BE INVOKED AS A DETERMINING REASON FOR THE APPLICATION OF THESE UNILATERAL SANCTIONING MEASURES IS EXAMINED. THIRDLY, IT EXAMINES THE ARGUMENT OF BAD FAITH PUT FORWARD BY THE EU AS THE ULTIMATE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE APPLICATION OF SUCH MEASURES.
137	WE WILL EXAMINE THE REVOLTS, BEGUN IN OCTOBER OF 2019, AND CURRENTLY DEVELOPING IN CHILE UNDER THREE CONJOINED PARTS. FIRST, WE WILL NOT TRY TO THEORETICALLY 'TAME' THE REVOLUTIONARY CREATURE, BUT RATHER TO PLUG IMMANENTLY INTO THE ENERGY OF THE 'POTENTIA' OF THE REVOLUTIONARY EVENT. TO THIS EXTENT, WE WILL HIGHLIGHT THE SHORTCOMINGS OF A THEORETICAL ENTERPRISE THAT INTENDS TO EXPLAIN IT IN TRADITIONAL TERMS OR THAT THRIVES FOR A VARIANT OF SIMPLE 'REFORMISM'. SECOND, AND CONSEQUENTLY, WE WILL DESCRIBE HOW THE CONCEPT OF THE CONSTITUTION (AND ITS PRACTICE) IS THE PERFECT PRODUCT OF COLONIALITY. HENCE, THE CONCEPT OF THE 'CONSTITUTIONAL TRAP' IS NOT SOMETHING UNIQUE TO THE CHILEAN EXPERIMENT, BUT THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL IDEA ITSELF IS THE MAIN PIPELINE OF COLONIALITY AND THE MOST SOPHISTICATED PRODUCT IN THE CONTENTION OF DEMOCRACY. THIRD, AND TO ENCOMPASS AND GIVE A PARTICULAR DIRECTION TO THE PREVIOUS TOPICS, WE WILL DEPLOY THE 'THEORY OF ENCRYPTION OF POWER' AND THE CONCEPT OF THE 'HIDDEN PEOPLE' (OR THE PEOPLE AS A SYNECDOCHE) TO EXPLICATE THE CHILEAN PHENOMENON UNDER A NEW LIGHT, WHERE NO PAST IS IRREVOCABLE, AND NO FUTURE IS NECESSARY.
138	INTRODUCTION: HISTORIANS, SINCE MILLER, WERE INTERESTED IN THE PROBLEMS OF THE HISTORY OF THE PRINCIPALITIES, LOCATED ON THE TERRITORY OF WESTERN SIBERIA. JOINING THE URALS TO RUSSIA CONTRIBUTED TO CHANGING THE POSITION OF LOCAL PRINCES, AND THEY WERE FORCED TO ADAPT TO NEW CONDITIONS, TRYING TO PRESERVE, IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, THEIR FORMER INFLUENCE ON LOCAL ALLOGENES. DYNASTY OF PRINCES IN OBDORSK PRINCIPALITY WAS THE LONGEST. OBJECTIVE: TO CLARIFY THE ROLE OF OBDORSK PRINCES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE TERRITORIES OF THE FAR NORTH AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT; TO SHOW THAT THIS RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPED IN DIFFERENT WAYS: SOME PRINCES WENT TO COOPERATION, OTHERS ACTIVELY OPPOSED THE PRESENCE OF RUSSIAN AND ESPECIALLY AGAINST THE SPREAD OF CHRISTIANITY; TO ANALYZE THE LITTLE-KNOWN FACT ABOUT A COMPLAINT OF PRINCE TAISHIN TO NICHOLAS I. RESEARCH MATERIALS: IN THE XIX CENTURY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE DYNASTY CONTINUED TO USE THE PATRONAGE OF RUSSIAN EMPERORS: THEY VISITED THE CAPITAL OF THE STATE AND HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT COMPLAINTS TO THEM PERSONALLY. IN 1854, PRINCE I.M. TAYSHIN HAD SUBMITTED IT VERBALLY, POINTING OUT THE FACT OF THE CAPTURE OF LANDS AND FISHERIES BY RUSSIANS AND INDUSTRIALISTS; HE HAD ASKED THE EMPEROR TO PROTECT HIM FROM THE ABUSE OF THEM. TO RESOLVE THE COMPLAINT, THE SIBERIAN COMMITTEE, THE AUTHORITIES OF WESTERN SIBERIA AND TOBOLSK PROVINCE WERE INVOLVED. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS THE EXTRACT FROM THE JOURNAL OF THE PRESENCE OF THE COUNCIL OF THE CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION OF WESTERN SIBERIA, THE CONTENT OF WHICH WILL HELP TO ELIMINATE THE INACCURACIES THAT OCCUR IN HISTORIOGRAPHY ON THE ISSUES UNDER CONSIDERATION. RESULTS AND NOVELTY OF THE RESEARCH: WE CORRECTED THE INACCURACIES IN THE CONSIDERATION OF THE TOPIC. IT WAS SHOWN HOW THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY REFUSED SERVICES OF OBDORSK PRINCES, WHOSE POWER HAD LONG BEEN NOMINAL.
139	FUKUYAMA TRIED TO EXPOUND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT IN CONTEMPORARY CHINA AND JUSTIFY ITS UNIVERSAL EFFECTIVENESS, WITH THE INTERPRETATION MODE OF MODERN POLITICAL ORDER SUPPORTED BY THE STATE, RULE OF LAW AND ACCOUNTABILITY. IT IS APPROPRIATE TO DESCRIBE, ANALYZE AND CONCLUDE THAT CURRENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT IN CHINA IS UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF A POWERFUL STATE, WEAK RULE OF LAW, AND SOFT ACCOUNTABILITY. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF THE PREMISE OF INTERPRETATION, IT IS DOUBTED THAT FUKUYAMA'S INTERPRETATION MODE OF MODERN POLITICAL ORDER, WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY THREE PILLARS, IS UNIVERSALLY EFFECTIVE. IT REMAINS UNSOLVED THAT THE STANDARD OF DEFINING MODERN STATE IS MUCH VAGUER RATHER THAN CLEARER, THE COURSE OF CHINA'S DEVELOPMENT IS MORE UNPREDICTABLE RATHER THAN MORE EXPLICIT, AND THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF MODERN POLITICAL ORDER IS MORE EVASIVE RATHER THAN MORE CERTAIN. IN GENERAL, FUKUYAMA'S INTERPRETATION OF MODERN POLITICAL ORDER IS RESTRAINED WITHIN ITS POSITIVE APPROACH. THEREFORE, HIS TASK OF IMPLEMENTING NORMATIVE INTERPRETATION IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY MODERN POLITICAL ORDER REMAINS UNACCOMPLISHED.
140	THE GLOBAL COMPACT FOR A SECURE, ORDERED AND REGULAR MIGRATION WAS ADOPTED ON DECEMBER 2018 BY 163 STATES AT THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE OF MARRAKECH AND SOME DAYS LATER, IT WAS ENDORSED BY GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED NATIONS IN ITS RESOLUTION 73/195. THIS PACT TOGETHER WITH THE PACT FOR REFUGEES FACES NORMATIVE ACTION THROUGH SOFT LAW TO ADOPT COMMON "RULES" FOR "HUMAN MOBILITY IN THE 21ST CENTURY". HOWEVER STATES PROCLAIM THEIR SOVEREIGNTY ON THE SUBJECT. THIS INSTRUMENT OF SOFT LAW SHOULD SERVE AS A REFERENCE FOR THE EXERCISE OF SOVEREIGN COMPETENCES IN ASPECTS THAT UNTIL NOW BELONGED TO DOMAINE RESERVE AND FOR THE ADOPTION OF A FRAMEWORK FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF REGULAR MIGRATION, ALTHOUGH IT ALSO MARKS THE REVERSE OF THE MANAGEMENT OF (UN) SAFE, (UN) ORDERED AND IRREGULAR MIGRATION. IT WILL ALSO GUIDE MULTILATERAL COOPERATION WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF MIGRATION.THIS ARTICLE WILL DEAL WITH THE SCOPE AND LEGAL NATURE OF THIS INSTRUMENT AND ITS CAPACITY TO TRIGGER A MODEL OF MANAGEMENT OF MIGRATION WHILE PRESERVING HUMAN RIGHTS.
141	ON ARMISTICE DAY, 2010, THE HIGH COURT HANDED DOWN A UNANIMOUS DECISION UPHOLDING THE RIGHTS OF ASYLUM SEEKERS HELD ON CHRISTMAS ISLAND TO HAVE THEIR APPLICATIONS DECIDED ACCORDING TO LAW AND THE RULES OF PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS. THE DECISION IN PLAINTIFF M61/2010E V COMMONWEALTH ('PLAINTIFF M61') WAS WIDELY REGARDED AS A VICTORY FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN AUSTRALIA. THIS CASE NOTE FIRST DISSECTS THE COURT'S SOPHISTICATED AND CONCISE REASONING IN PLAINTIFF M61. IT THEN CONSIDERS BRIEFLY THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE DECISION TO CONTINUE PROCESSING ASYLUM SEEKERS ON CHRISTMAS ISLAND. THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PLANS TO RE-INSTITUTE REGIONAL PROCESSING IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA OR NAURU ARE CONSIDERED IN GREATER DETAIL. THE ARGUMENT OF THIS CASE NOTE IS AN OPTIMISTIC ONE: THAT THE CENTRALITY OF THE RULE OF LAW IN AUSTRALIAN JURISPRUDENCE SUGGESTS STRONGLY THAT AN ATTEMPT TO REMOVE ASYLUM SEEKERS FROM THE REACH OF THE COURTS MAY NOT BE AS EASY AS TAKING THEM OFFSHORE.
142	IN R (EVANS) V ATTORNEY GENERAL, THE SUPREME COURT QUASHED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S STATUTORY VETO OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL'S ORIGINAL DETERMINATION MADE UNDER FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LEGISLATION. THE UPPER TRIBUNAL HAD HELD THAT SO-CALLED 'ADVOCACY' MEMOS SHOULD BE PUBLISHED AFTER A FULL HEARING ON THE MERITS. THE SUPREME COURT SPLIT FIVE TO TWO, WITH THE LEAD JUDGMENT OF LORD NEUBERGER USING CONSTITUTIONAL RATHER THAN ADMINISTRATIVE LANGUAGE AND FOCUSING ON THE RULE OF LAW. THIS NOTE RAISES FOUR OBJECTIONS TO THE LEAD JUDGMENT. FIRST, IT ARGUES THAT THE UPPER TRIBUNAL WAS ACTING IN AN EXECUTIVE NOT JUDICIAL CAPACITY AND THE VETO WAS NOT THEREFORE A BREACH OF THE RULE OF LAW. SECONDLY IT SUGGESTS THE VETO CLAUSE IS BEST UNDERSTOOD AS A VARIANT HENRY VIII CLAUSE. THIRDLY, IT SUGGESTS LORD NEUBERGER'S JUDGMENT IS FOUNDED ON A PARADOX. FINALLY, IT ARGUES THAT THE JUDGMENT UNDERMINES PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY. FUTURE IMPLICATIONS ARE THEN CONSIDERED.
143	SOUTH KOREA EXPERIENCED DEMOCRATIZATION IN 1987, YET VIOLATIONS OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW ARE RATHER COMMON; SUCH ACTIONS ARE FAR FROM ROUTINE PRACTICES OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. WE ARGUE THAT SOUTH KOREA'S POLITICAL CULTURE IS THE REASON FOR THE TARDY MATURING OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.
144	CONFRONTED WITH STALLED VACCINATION EFFORTS AGAINST COVID-19, MANY GOVERNMENTS EMBRACED MANDATES AND OTHER MEASURES TO INCENTIVIZE VACCINATION THAT EXCLUDED THE UNVACCINATED FROM ASPECTS OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC LIFE. EVEN STILL, MANY CITIZENS REMAINED UNVACCINATED. WE ADVANCE A SOCIAL CONTRACT FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING WHO REMAINS UNVACCINATED AND WHY. WE LEVERAGE BOTH OBSERVATIONAL AND INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL SURVEY EVIDENCE FROM ITALY TO STUDY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VACCINATION STATUS AND SOCIAL CONTEXT, SOCIAL TRUST, POLITICAL PARTISANSHIP, AND ADHERENCE TO CORE INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW AND COLLECTIVE COMMITMENTS. WE FIND THAT ATTITUDES TOWARD THE RULE OF LAW AND COLLECTIVE COMMITMENTS OUTSIDE THE DOMAIN OF VACCINATION ARE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH COMPLIANCE WITH VACCINE MANDATES AND INCENTIVES. PARTISANSHIP ALSO CORRESPONDS WITH VACCINE BEHAVIORS, AS SUPPORTERS OF PARTIES WHOSE LEADERS CRITICIZED AGGRESSIVE POLICIES TO INCENTIVIZE OR MANDATE VACCINATION AND EMPHASIZED INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY ARE LEAST LIKELY TO COMPLY. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST APPEALS EMPHASIZING INDIVIDUAL BENEFITS MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN APPEALS EMPHASIZING COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY.
145	TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IN LATIN AMERICA EMERGED IN RELATION TO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AT THE PERIOD OF TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY FROM DICTATORSHIP. VENEZUELA WAS OFTEN CONSIDERED AN EXCEPTION SINCE IT GENERALLY AVOIDED THE PROLONGED MILITARY DICTATORSHIPS, WHICH GRIPPED THE REGION DURING MUCH OF THE COLD WAR. UNDER CLOSER SCRUTINY THOUGH, VENEZUELA HAS HAD A HISTORY OF VIOLENT POLITICS BUT WITH LITTLE ACCOUNTABILITY. THE CARACAZO STANDS OUT AS THE WORST CASE OF REPRESSION, WHICH BECAME A POLITICALLY SYMBOLIC EVENT FOR PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ AS IT ADDRESSES BOTH ASPECTS OF THE BOLIVARIAN EXPERIMENT: REDRESSING INEQUALITY AND IMPLEMENTING THE RULE OF LAW. THIS PAPER LOOKS AT THE ADVANCES AND CONTRADICTIONS VENEZUELA HAS DONE IN TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE DURING THE BOLIVARIAN EXPERIMENT (1999PRESENT). TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IS RELEVANT TO THE BOLIVARIAN EXPERIMENT BECAUSE JUSTICE EMERGES AS PART OF ESTABLISHING A NEW RULE OF LAW BY IMPLEMENTING STATE INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL, JUDICIAL, POLICE AND PRISON SYSTEMS.
146	THIS STUDY FURTHER EMPIRICALLY EXAMINES THE INFLUENCE OF BOARD INDEPENDENCE ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE BY USING THE WORLD'S TOP 1000 FIRMS. CEO DUALITY AND THE PERCENTAGE OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS ARE USED AS THE INDICATORS OF BOARD INDEPENDENCE. MOREOVER, THIS STUDY RE-ADDRESSES THE FINDINGS IN THE LITERATURE BY GIVING SUPPLEMENT IN THEORY AND CONDUCTING TESTS FOR THE INFLUENCE OF BOARD INDEPENDENCE ON FIRM PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS THE MODERATING EFFECTS OF COUNTRY GOVERNANCE, FOCUSING ON REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW, WITH MULTI-LEVEL MODELING, A MORE SOPHISTICATED STATISTICAL APPROACH. FOUR HYPOTHESES, BASED ON AGENCY THEORY AND COMPENSATION THEORY, WERE DEVELOPED. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT CEO DUALITY AND THE PERCENTAGE OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS EXERTED, RESPECTIVELY, NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON RETURN ON ASSETS (ROA), A FIRM PERFORMANCE INDICATOR. FURTHERMORE, REGULATORY QUALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW POSITIVELY MODERATED THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THE FORMER AND NEGATIVELY MODERATED THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF THE LATTER. SOME PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS WERE DISCUSSED BASED ON THE RESULTS OBTAINED.
147	DIGITAL DISOBEDIENCE CAN BE DEFINED AS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED ONLINE LAWBREAKING. IT INCLUDES DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE ACTIONS, HACKTIVISM, DIGITALLY BASED LEAKING (FOR EXAMPLE, ANONYMOUS, WIKILEAKS), AND WHISTLEBLOWING (ALONG THE LINES PURSUED BY CHELSEA MANNING AND EDWARD SNOWDEN). GIVEN ITS GROWING POLITICAL IMPORTANCE, THE PHENOMENON REQUIRES CAREFUL THEORETICAL ATTENTION. AGAINST THE WIDESPREAD TENDENCY TO CRIMINALIZE DIGITAL DISOBEDIENCE BY APPEALING TO CONVENTIONAL NOTIONS OF THE 'RULE OF LAW', THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT SOME OF ITS PROPONENTS ARE IN FACT ENGAGING IN DIGITAL LAWBREAKING AS EXPRESSIONS OF THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW. ALTHOUGH THIS DIAGNOSIS HIGHLIGHTS THE PARTIAL OVERLAP WITH CONVENTIONAL MODELS OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE (WHICH OFTENTIMES SIMILARLY CONCEIVE OF POLITICALLY MOTIVATED LAWBREAKING AS NECESSARILY RESTING ON A MORE FUNDAMENTAL RESPECT FOR THE LAW), WE SHOULD HESITATE BEFORE VIEWING DIGITAL DISOBEDIENCE SIMPLY AS MODERNIZED OR DIGITALIZED CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. DIGITAL DISOBEDIENCE INCLUDES SOME POLITICAL NOVELTIES, AND TRADITIONAL VIEWS OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE ONLY GET US SO FAR IN MAKING SENSE OF THOSE NOVELTIES.
148	CARL SCHMITT'S BOOK "CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY" OF 1928, A WORK WIDELY DISCUSSED DURING THE TIME WHEN IT WAS FIRST PUBLISHED, STILL REMAINS RELEVANT AS OF TODAY. UPON ANALYSING THE RELATION BETWEEN THE BOURGEOIS STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW ESTABLISHED WITH THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE DEMAND OF THE PEOPLE FOR POLITICAL REPRESENTATION AS CONSTITUENT POWER BASED ON CONTEMPORARY WESTERN STATES OF 19TH CENTURY, SCHMITT SHOWED THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRATIC STATE DOES NOT ALWAYS CORRELATE WITH EACH OTHER. ON THE OTHER HAND, LED BY THE CONCEPT OF POSITIVE CONSTITUTION, SCHMITT ASSERTS THAT THE EXISTENTIALIST POLITICAL CHOICES OF THE PEOPLE NECESSARILY REQUIRE UNAMENDABLE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE WEIMAR CONSTITUTION NOT INCLUDING UNAMENDABLE PROVISIONS BUT MERELY PROVIDING FOR QUALIFIED MAJORITY FOR CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS. SCHMITT'S WORK, WHICH DESERVES BEING CALLED AS A "CLASSIC", CONSTITUTES A UNIQUE TREASURE SEEKING FOR SOLUTIONS FOR SOCIETIES EXPERIENCING CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS STUCK WITHIN THE DICHOTOMY OF REVOLUTION AND COUP D'ETAT OR SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION.
149	AT FIRST SIGHT CONSTITUTIONALISM APPEARS TO BE A KEY CONCEPT IN PUBLIC LAW DISCOURSE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. IT APPEARS IN ALL THE MAJOR ACADEMIC DISCUSSIONS FROM THE RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL REVIEW TO THE 'NEW CONSTITUTIONAL SETTLEMENT' AND IN RELATION TO CONSTITUTIONAL CULTURE. AND YET ATTEMPTS TO DEFINE THE SCOPE, MEANING AND ROLE OF CONSTITUTIONALISM REMAIN VAGUE. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE DIFFERENT FIELDS IN WHICH CONSTITUTIONALISM IS DISCUSSED AND THE DIFFERENT MEANINGS THAT ARE ATTRIBUTED TO THE CONCEPT. IT SHOWS THAT CONSTITUTIONALISM IS ROUTINELY CONFLATED BY PUBLIC LAW SCHOLARS WITH OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES AND PRINCIPLES, LIKE THE RULE OF LAW OR SEPARATION OF POWERS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT CONSTITUTIONALISM SHOULD EITHER BE CONCEIVED AS DISTINCT FROM THOSE CONCEPTS OR, FAILING THAT, CAN SAFELY BE ELIMINATED FROM PUBLIC LAW DISCOURSE. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY ASKING WHETHER A NUANCED AND NORMATIVE DISCUSSION OF CONSTITUTIONALISM COULD HAVE ANY MEANINGFUL APPLICATION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM CONSTITUTION.
150	THIS PAPER EXAMINES HOW THE GOVERNANCE CONTEXT AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MAY RELATE TO DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF A COUNTRY'S FINANCIAL SYSTEM BEFORE AND AFTER A CRISIS. USING A FIXED-EFFECTS REGRESSION MODEL FOR PANEL DATA AND A COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE, WE ASSESS LONGITUDINAL TRENDS IN THE FUNCTIONING OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEMS. THIS MODELING ALLOWS US TO EXPLORE HOW THE LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT OF 139 COUNTRIES AND CONDITIONS RELATED TO POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW, MAY HAVE INFLUENCED FINANCIAL SYSTEM OUTCOMES. WE MEASURE FINANCIAL SYSTEM OUTCOMES ACROSS FOUR DIMENSIONS: FINANCIAL DEPTH, EFFICIENCY, STABILITY, AND ACCESS. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE EXPLANATORY VARIABLES HAD LIMITED STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE ON THE PROXY MEASURES OF FINANCIAL SYSTEM OUTCOMES. FURTHERMORE, THE RELATIONSHIPS WERE NOT CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL FINANCIAL SYSTEM OUTCOME VARIABLES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT POLITICAL STABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW DO INFLUENCE DEPTH AND EFFICIENCY, RESPECTIVELY, AS PROXY INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL SYSTEM OUTCOMES.
151	EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF MUTUAL RECOGNITION IN THE AREA OF FREEDOM, SECURITY, AND JUSTICE REQUIRES MUTUAL TRUST BETWEEN THE MEMBER STATES. MUTUAL TRUST HAS BEEN ERODED IN SOME MEMBER STATES DUE TO THE RULE OF LAW CRISIS. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT ONLY THE RULE OF LAW CRISIS, BUT ALSO THE ABANDONMENT OF THE SHARED VALUES OF RESPECT FOR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AS WELL AS THE DIFFERENCES IN THE PROSECUTORIAL SYSTEMS OF RESPECTIVE MEMBER STATES, WHICH HAVE CAUSED CHANGES IN THE PERCEPTION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF MUTUAL RECOGNITION. THIS PAPER WILL EXAMINE THE EVOLVING APPROACH TO THE PRINCIPLE OF MUTUAL RECOGNITION BASED ON THE RECENT COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION RULINGS ON THE EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANT. THE ANALYSIS CONCLUDES THAT THE CJEU ATTACHES MORE IMPORTANCE TO THE PROTECTION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF MUTUAL RECOGNITION, THE PROSECUTION OF PERPETRATORS OF CRIME, AND THE UNWAVERING PRESUMPTION OF RESPECT FOR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS BY THE MEMBER STATES THAN TO THE EFFECTIVE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.
152	ALTHOUGH THE KEY PURPOSE OF INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW IS TO PROMOTE FOREIGN INVESTOR PROTECTION BY OFFERING BOTH SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL STANDARDS, THE INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT GOVERNANCE REGIME NEEDS TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN FOREIGN INVESTOR RIGHTS PROTECTION AND THE HOST STATE'S RIGHT TO REGULATE. THE CHANGING BALANCE OF THIS DICHOTOMY SHAPES A LEAVING-AND-RETURN-OF-THE-STATE PARADIGM WHICH EXPLAINS AND RATIONALIZES AN EVOLUTIONARY DEVELOPMENT OF BOTH SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL NORMS AND THE CHANGING STATUS OF SOVEREIGNTY IN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW. THE "LEAVING" OR "RETURN" OF THE STATE PARADIGM INFORMS US OF THE ROLE OF THE STATE IN THE CONTEXT OF INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW. THIS ARTICLE MAKES A NORMATIVE CASE FOR REFRAMING INVESTMENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY WITHIN WHAT WE CALL THE INVESTMENT RULE OF LAW. BOTH PUSH FOR AND PULL FROM A LIBERALIZATION MOVEMENT ARE IN AN ATTEMPT TO RESHAPE THIS INVESTMENT RULE OF LAW SURROUNDING THE CONCEPT OF SOVEREIGNTY, THE CORE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.
153	THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE POLITICO-CONSTITUTIONAL UPHEAVALS THAT TOOK PLACE IN TURKEY SINCE 15 JULY 2016. WHILE A STATE OF EMERGENCY HAS BEEN PROCLAIMED TO RESTORE THE PUBLIC ORDER DISTURBED BY THE ATTEMPTED MILITARY COUP, A CONSTITUTIONAL MODIFICATION, ADDRESSED TO REMOVE THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM, HAS BEEN ADOPTED UNDER EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES. THE FIRST QUESTION WE CONSIDERED IN THIS PAPER IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY PROCLAIMED, BOTH IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE BINDING CONSTITUTION AND THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS. SECONDLY, WE ANALYZED THE CONSTITUTIONAL MODIFICATIONS, WHICH APPEAR VERY RADICAL WITH RESPECT TO THE CONTINUITY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER, WITH RESPECT TO THE TIME DIMENSION OF ITS EFFECTS, TO THE PROCEDURE ADOPTED AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW. WE FINALLY ASKED OURSELVES WHETHER SUCH ''NEW ORDER'' ! IS SUSTAINABLE IN A POLITICAL ORGANIZATION CONCEIVED AS A DEMOCRATIC STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RESPECT OF HUMAN RIGHTS.
154	STUDIES OF HOW INDIVIDUALS' MICRO-MOTIVES AND BEHAVIORS INFLUENCE THE EFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW ARE A DEFICIT IN THE LITERATURE, AS IS ANALYSIS OF THE MICROFOUNDATIONS OF THE LAW. MOST EXPLANATIONS OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW CONCERN THE MACRO LEVEL AND EMULATE PROPERTIES OF COUNTRIES, SUCH AS WEALTH, ETHNIC FRAGMENTATION, RELIGION, BRITISH LEGAL OR COLONIAL TRADITION, OR COMMUNIST PAST. ASSUMING THAT WRITTEN LAW WILL BE LARGELY IRRELEVANT IF THE RULES ARE EXCESSIVELY COSTLY COMPARED TO OTHER MECHANISMS FOR PRIVATE AND PUBLIC INTERACTIONS, SUCH AS INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS OR ILLEGAL PRACTICES, IN THIS WORK I MODEL THE GAME THAT UNDERLIES THE WELL-KNOWN CORRUPT ACT OF "MORDIDA" IN MEXICO CITY, THAT IS, BRIBE SEEKING AND OFFERING WHEN A CITIZEN IS ACCUSED OF OR COMMITS A TRAFFIC INFRINGEMENT. THE FIRST CONCLUSION IS THAT CORRUPTION IS THE GAME'S DOMINANT STRATEGY. THE SECOND IS THAT SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF THE PENALTY ITSELF IN MEXICO CITY ARE THE MAIN FACTORS THAT MAKE CORRUPTION THE EQUILIBRIUM OF THE "BRIBE GAME."
155	THE INTERNATIONAL LEGALIZATION PROCESS HAS TRIGGERED A DEBATE OVER THE SCOPE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IN WHICH OPTIMISTS ASSERT THE EMERGENCE OF AN INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW WHILE SKEPTICS DOUBT INTERNATIONAL LEGAL NORMS EFFECTIVELY BIND STATES. SOME MULTILATERAL TREATIES INCLUDE PROVISIONS ON DISPUTE RESOLUTION SEEKING TO REGULATE STATE BEHAVIOR. WE INTRODUCE A FRAMEWORK TO ASSESS THE JUDICIALIZATION OF SUCH DISPUTE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES AND CORRESPONDING STATE PRACTICES. IN THE ISSUE AREAS OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE (GATT/WTO), INTERNATIONAL SECURITY (UNSC), AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (CITES), WE ANALYZE STATE BEHAVIOR IN DISPUTES ARISING FROM SELECTED TREATY NORMS AND COMPARE TRENDS ACROSS TIME AND ISSUE AREAS. OUR DATA REVEALS AN UNEVEN JUDICIALIZATION, WHICH DIFFERS CONSIDERABLY BETWEEN ISSUE AREAS AND ALSO DEPENDS ON WHETHER STATES ACT AS COMPLAINANTS OR DEFENDANTS. ALL IN ALL, THERE IS NO UNIFORM TREND TOWARDS AN INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, BUT HIGH JUDICIALIZATION IN THE TRADE SECTOR ONLY, WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL SECTOR IN MIDFIELD AND SECURITY ISSUES CLEARLY LAGGING BEHIND.
156	TAIWAN'S POLITICAL DEMOCRATIZATION HAS ENGENDERED A CONTRADICTION IN ITS LEGAL REGIME: CONSOLIDATION OF RULE OF LAW AT THE MACRO-INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL IS MATCHED BY THE PERSISTENT MARGINALIZATION OF LEGAL AUTHORITY IN GROUND-LEVEL SOCIAL PRACTICES. THIS ARTICLE USES AN ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDY OF NEIGHBORHOOD POLICE TO EXPLORE CERTAIN PRACTICAL AND STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS INVOLVED IN MAINTAINING THIS CONTRADICTORY SOCIOPOLITICAL ORDER. I EXAMINE SOME OF THE PROCESSES THROUGH WHICH STATE AUTHORITY IS INVOKED AND APPLIED TO THE POLICING OF PUBLIC SPACE, FOCUSING ON THE IDEALS OF LEGITIMACY THAT ANIMATE THESE PROCESSES. THE ARGUMENT OF THE ARTICLE IS THAT HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL FACTORS EMBODIED IN CONTEMPORARY TAIWAN'S "IDEA OF POLICE"-EXEMPLIFIED IN THE TROPE OF A BALANCE BETWEEN REASON, LAW, AND SENTIMENT-ARE CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTANDING HOW SOLIDIFICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN STATE INSTITUTIONS IS KEPT WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF A SOCIAL SENSIBILITY THAT DOES NOT TAKE LAW AS THE LAST WORD.
157	THIS PAPER USES PANEL DATA FROM 31 DEVELOPED COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 2002 TO 2018 BY APPLYING A GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM) AND SYSTEM GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS (SYS GMM), POOLED OLS, FIXED EFFECT, AND RANDOM EFFECT TO LOOK AT THE EFFECT OF SIX INDICATORS OF GOVERNANCE ON ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE STUDY FINDS DIRECT SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF RULE OF LAW, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY ON ECONOMIC GROWTH OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES WHICH INDICATE THAT DEVELOPED COUNTRIES' ECONOMY INCREASES DUE TO INCREASE IN RULE OF LAW OR CONTROL OF CORRUPTION OR VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THE STUDY ALSO FINDS INDIRECT SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND REGULATORY QUALITY ON ECONOMIC GROWTH WHICH IMPLY DECLINE IN THE ECONOMY OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES DUE TO 1% INCREASE IN GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND REGULATORY QUALITY. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY APPARENTLY DEMONSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF GOVERNANCE INDICATORS TO GET BETTER THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES' ECONOMY.
158	IN THE RECENT CONSTITUTIONALISM OF THE SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC STATE, SUBJECT TO THE RULE OF LAW, THE BASIC ITEM IS THE FIRST ONE, THE SOCIAL STATE. NEVERTHELESS, IN THE TREATY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THE SOCIAL STATE DOES NOT APPEAR, IT IS CONSTRUCTED AGAINST THIS PRINCIPLE.
159	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE RELEVANCE OF GOVERNMENT QUALITY IN MODERATING THE INCIDENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION ON INCLUSIVE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN 44 SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 2000-2012. ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION IS MEASURED WITH CO2 EMISSIONS AND THE GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS INCLUDE: POLITICAL STABILITY, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATION QUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION-CONTROL. THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS BASED ON THE GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENTS. REGULATION QUALITY MODULATES CO2 EMISSIONS TO EXERT A NET NEGATIVE EFFECT ON INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT. INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE (CONSISTING OF CORRUPTION-CONTROL AND THE RULE OF LAW) MODULATES CO2 EMISSIONS TO ALSO EXERT A NET NEGATIVE EFFECT ON INCLUSIVE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. FORTUNATELY, THE CORRESPONDING INTERACTIVE EFFECTS ARE POSITIVE, WHICH INDICATES THAT GOOD GOVERNANCE NEEDS TO BE ENHANCED TO ACHIEVE POSITIVE NET EFFECTS. A POLICY THRESHOLD OF INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE AT WHICH INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE COMPLETELY DAMPENS THE UNFAVOURABLE EFFECT OF CO2 EMISSIONS ON INCLUSIVE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IS ESTABLISHED. OTHER POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED.
160	THIS EMPIRICAL STUDY INVESTIGATES THE IMPACTS OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT), EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, THE RULE OF LAW AND OTHER DETERMINANTAL VARIABLES ON THE GROWTH OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCTS (GDP) AMONG 35 LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCS) IN AFRICA AND ASIA. THE RESULTS OF THIS EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS ON ARCHIVAL DATA FROM 1997 TO 2007 SHOW THAT WHILE ICT EXPANSION IN LDCS HAS MANY POSITIVE IMPACTS ON GDP GROWTH IN THESE COUNTRIES, THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COUNTRIES IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF CITIZENS' EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, THE RULE OF LAW, GOVERNMENTAL INTERVENTION IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES AND THE LEVEL OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) CAN BOTH ENHANCE AND RESTRICT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ICT AND GDP GROWTH. THIS STUDY PROPOSES AN E-COMMERCE MODEL CALLED VIRTUAL BAZAAR. THE MODEL IS ADAPTED TO THE EXISTING LEVEL OF ICT INFRASTRUCTURE IN LDCS IN ORDER TO ENABLE THE MICRO-TRADE OWNERS TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS ACROSS THE GLOBE, HENCE INCREASING THEIR LEVEL OF INCOMES.
161	CHINA IS FREQUENTLY PORTRAYED AS A PROBLEM CASE FOR THE LAW AND DEVELOPMENT MOVEMENT BECAUSE IT HAS ACHIEVED ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH A WEAK LEGAL SYSTEM, HAS RESISTED THE THIRD WAVE OF DEMOCRATIZATION, AND HAS A POOR RECORD ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS. IS CHINA A PROBLEM CASE? THE AUTHOR THINKS NOT, OR AT LEAST THAT IT IS TOO EARLY TO TELL. CHINA IS NOW FOLLOWING THE PATH OF OTHER EAST ASIAN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE ACHIEVED SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH, ESTABLISHED RULE OF LAW, AND DEVELOPED CONSTITUTIONAL OR RIGHTS-BASED DEMOCRACIES, ALBEIT NOT NECESSARILY LIBERAL RIGHTS-BASED DEMOCRACIES. AT THIS STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, FOR ALL OF ITS PROBLEMS, CHINA IS MEETING OR EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS ON MOST MEASURES. CHINA OUTPERFORMS THE AVERAGE COUNTRY IN ITS INCOME CLASS IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH, RULE OF LAW AND MOST HUMAN RIGHTS MEASURES, AND OTHER INDICATORS OF HUMAN WELL-BEING WITH THE NOTABLE EXCEPTION OF CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS.
162	LOCKE'S ENDORSEMENT OF PREROGATIVE, THE POWER OF THE EXECUTIVE TO EXCEED POSITIVE LAWS IN EMERGENCIES, SEEMS TO CONTRADICT HIS POLITICAL AND THEORETICAL AIMS IN WRITING THE TWO TREATISES OF GOVERNMENT, PARTICULARLY HIS VINDICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN A CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT PREROGATIVE AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE CONSISTENT IN THE ULTIMATE ENDS THAT THEY SERVE, IN SPITE OF THEIR SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AS MEANS. PREROGATIVE IS ESSENTIAL TO THE REALIZATION OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES OF GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING THE PRESERVATION OF SOCIETY, BECAUSE UNFORESEEABLE CONTINGENCIES MAKE IT DIFFICULT AND EVEN COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE TO RELY EXCLUSIVELY ON JURIDICAL MEANS OF FULFILLING THESE DUTIES. PREROGATIVE COMPENSATES FOR THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE LAW WITHOUT ABANDONING THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY ALTOGETHER BY ALLOWING THE EXECUTIVE TO EXERCISE EXTRA-ORDINARY POWERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HIGHEST LAW OF ALL: THE GOOD OF THE PEOPLE AS DEFINED BY THE LAWS OF NATURE.
163	THE INSTITUTIONS OF PATRONAGE, CLIENTELISM AND NEPOTISM ARE RESILIENT AND OBSTRUCT POLITICAL LIBERALISATION AND DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION. THIS PAPER DRAWS ON HISTORICAL (NEO)INSTITUTIONALISM, DEMOCRATISATION RESEARCH AND STUDIES IN ECONOMIC HISTORY TO UNDERSTAND THE REPRODUCTION MECHANISMS OF INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS IN EU'S EASTERN NEIGHBOURHOOD, AND TO PROPOSE A POLICY RESPONSE, WHICH COULD HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DISRUPT THESE MECHANISMS. OUTSOURCING NATIONAL JUDICIARY SYSTEMS FROM EU'S EASTERN NEIGHBOURHOOD TO EXTERNAL RULE OF LAW MISSIONS MIGHT OFFER ONE SOLUTION AS LONG AS THEY SATISFY AT LEAST TWO CONDITIONS: (1) THEY NEED TO HAVE A TARGETED EXECUTIVE MANDATE; AND (2) THEY MUST BE DEPLOYED WITH THE SUPPORT OF AN AUTHORITATIVE INTERNATIONAL ACTOR, SUCH AS THE EU OR UN, UNDER CONDITIONS OF CONCERTED INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS AND SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. LOCAL ACTORS MIGHT OPPOSE THIS INFRINGEMENT OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY. EXTERNAL RULE OF LAW MISSIONS SHOULD THEREFORE BE PROPOSED DURING A DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION WHEN REFORMERS RELY ON EXTERNAL SUPPORT.
164	IT IS WELL RECOGNIZED THAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) VIOLATIONS ARE AT THE HEART OF THE ECONOMIC CONFLICT WITH CHINA. LITTLE AGREEMENT, HOWEVER, EXISTS ABOUT THE ORIGIN AND SOLUTIONS FOR THIS PROVOCATION. BROADLY SPEAKING, TWO PRESCRIPTIONS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED: THE NATURAL EVOLUTIONARY AND THE RULE OF LAW VIEWS. WHILE BOTH HAVE MERITS AND ADD TO OUR UNDERSTANDING, THEY DO NOT GO FAR ENOUGH TO ADDRESS THE MORE FUNDAMENTAL IPR POLICY ISSUE: CHINA HAS BENEFITED FROM A RULE OF LAW OVERSEAS AND A RULE THROUGH LAW AT HOME, MANUFACTURING UNFAIR ADVANTAGE TO ITS FIRMS, MANY OF WHICH ARE OWNED AND/OR INFLUENCED BY THE GOVERNMENT. WHILE RECOGNIZING CHINA'S RECENT EFFORT IN IMPROVING IPR PROTECTION, WE POINT OUT THE INTRINSIC CONTRADICTION IN THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF CHINA BETWEEN MAINTAINING THE ONE-PARTY RULE, ON THE ONE HAND, AND PROTECTING IPR BY AN INDEPENDENT COURT, ON THE OTHER. UNDERSTANDING THIS TENSION IN THE APPLICATION OF IPR LAW CAN HELP THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SEARCH FOR MORE EFFECTIVE POLICY OPTIONS.
165	THE PAPER ANALYZES THE RELEVANCE OF DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS FOR EXPORT PERFORMANCE OF CAMBODIA. REGULATORY QUALITY, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, RULE OF LAW, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND POLITICAL STABILITY ARE INTRODUCED IN AN AUGMENTED GRAVITY MODEL WITH A PANEL DATA SET OVER 1996-2015. THE RESEARCH IS THE FIRST APPLICATION TO CAMBODIA, UNTIL 2015 A LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRY WHICH IS GENERALLY BELIEVED TO HAVE POORLY DEVELOPED INSTITUTIONS. DUE TO HIGH MULTICOLLINEARITY AMONG THE VARIABLES, THE INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES ARE INTRODUCED IN THE MODEL ONE BY ONE. ESTIMATION IS BY THE HAUSMAN-TAYLOR METHOD, WHICH REDUCES OR REMOVES THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE COMPOSITE ERROR TERMS AND THE INCLUDED VARIABLES. ALL INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES SHOW A HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH CAMBODIA'S EXPORTS, WITH RULE OF LAW HAVING THE LARGEST IMPACT. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD GIVE HIGH PRIORITY TO THE FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS OF THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT AND TO STRONG ENFORCEMENT OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AND CONTRACTS.
166	INSTITUTIONAL FORCES INFLUENCE THE FORMATION OF INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES (IJVS) IN EMERGING ECONOMIES AND SHAPE BOTH THEIR PARENTS' BEHAVIORS AND THEIR MARKETING STRATEGIES. WHEREAS PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS CENTERED ON GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS THAT DETER OPPORTUNISM, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE INFLUENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL FORCES (I.E., RULE OF LAW, GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION, AND DYSFUNCTIONAL COMPETITION) ON THE IJV'S FOREIGN PARENT'S OPPORTUNISM. THE AUTHORS FIND THAT RULE OF LAW AND DYSFUNCTIONAL COMPETITION CURTAIL OPPORTUNISM, WHEREAS GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION DRIVES OPPORTUNISM. IN ADDITION, RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL FORCES IN LOCAL MARKETS AND THE IJV'S FOREIGN PARENT'S OPPORTUNISM DEPEND ON THE IJV'S MARKETING CAPABILITY. THE AUTHORS FURTHER EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE OF THE FOREIGN PARENT'S OPPORTUNISM ON IJV RELATIONSHIP EXTENDEDNESS AND FIND SUPPORT FOR A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OPPORTUNISM AND THE IJV'S CONTINUITY. THIS STUDY ENRICHES INSTITUTIONAL THEORY AND IDENTIFIES THE BOUNDARY OF THE INFLUENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL FORCES ON OPPORTUNISM. BECAUSE OPPORTUNISM IS A CRITICAL RELATIONSHIP HAZARD, THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR IJVS' PARTNERSHIP MANAGEMENT.
167	IN RECENT YEARS, THE CORPORATION AND THE CONCEPTS OF INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR CONCEPTS IN THE LITERATURE. IN PARTICULAR, THE NEW GROWTH THEORIES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE EFFECTS OF CORPORATIONS AND THE INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE ON MACRO-LEVEL ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. HI THESE THEORIES, CORPORATION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENT FOR THE ECONOMIC GROWTH PROCESS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO TEST THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN 30 OECD COUNTRIES BY USING THE DATA OF 2009 THROUGH THE CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSIS METHOD. IN THE STUDY, THE VARIABLES OF POLITICAL STABILITY, ACCOUNTABILITY, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GOVERNMENTS, REGULATORY QUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW AND THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION WERE USED AS INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE INDICATORS. ACCORDING W THE OBTAINED RESULTS, THE VARIABLES OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW HAVE A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE EFFECT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH. ON THE OTHER HAND, NO SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE AND ECONOMIC GROWTH.
168	FOLLOWING ITS TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY FROM AN AUTHORITARIAN MILITARY RULE MARKED BY GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, NIGERIA ESTABLISHED THE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS INVESTIGATIONS COMMISSION (HRVIC) IN 1999. THIS PAPER CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE HRVIC, POPULARLY KNOWN AS THE 'OPUTA PANEL,' TO THE FIELD OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW. IT SETS OUT THE PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING THE COMMISSION, ITS MANDATE AND HOW THIS MANDATE WAS INTERPRETED DURING THE COURSE OF THE COMMISSION'S WORK. THE CHALLENGES FACED BY THE OPUTA PANEL, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT RELATE TO ITS LEGAL STATUS AND RELATIONSHIP WITH THE JUDICIARY, ARE ANALYZED IN AN ATTEMPT TO DRAW USEFUL GUIDELINES FROM THESE CHALLENGES FOR OTHER TRUTH COMMISSIONS. RECOURSE BY POWERFUL INDIVIDUALS TO THE JUDICIAL PROCESS IN A BID TO SHIELD THEMSELVES FROM THE HRVIC MERITS PARTICULAR REVIEW AS IT RAISES QUESTIONS REGARDING THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE JUDICIARY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE WAKE OF AN AUTHORITARIAN REGIME.
169	THE GOVERNANCE OF THE SOCIAL RULE OF LAW IS EXAMINED FROM THE DECISIONS MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT IN THE NAME OF BIOPOLITICS, FROM THE APPEARANCE OF COVID-19 (MARCH 2020). THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO INTERPRET THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL AGREEMENTS THAT DERIVE FROM THAT INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN ON WHICH GOVERNANCE WAS BASED IN MODERN PRE-COVID-19 SOCIETY, AND ON THE OTHER HAND, THE DECISIONS OF GOVERNMENTS, REGARDING THE DECLARATION OF A PANDEMIC BY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION-WHO. WE PROCEEDED TO ANALYZE THE CONTENT AND FORMS PRESENT IN THE GOVERNMENT DECISIONS THAT DETERMINED THE PERIOD OF CONFINEMENT AND THE SUBSEQUENT RELAXATION PROCESSES. IN CONCLUSION, IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT ELEMENTS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A POST-PANDEMIC SOCIETY WILL DEPEND LARGELY ON THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTH FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE FREEDOMS AND PROTECTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW SINCE IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTH, THIS RELATIONSHIP WOULD DANGER TO THE SOCIETY OF FREEDOMS.
170	THE ARTICLE PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF AN INVESTIGATION CARRIED OUT ON COMPLIANCE BY THE URUGUAYAN STATE WITH RESPECT TO THE SENTENCES PASSED AGAINST IT, MAKING A TEMPORARY CUTOFF FOR THE ANALYSIS, BETWEEN THE YEARS 2010 TO 2020. THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF THE INVESTIGATION IS FOCUSES ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A CONCEPTUAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL CATEGORY, ALSO STUDYING COMPLIANCE WITH SENTENCES AS AN INDICATOR OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE EMPIRICAL FRAMEWORK IS MADE UP OF A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DIMENSION OF ANALYSIS, THE CONTRAST OF WHICH ALLOWS US TO ARRIVE AT THE LAST CONCLUSIONS. AMONG THEM, AND WITHOUT EXPLICITLY EXHAUSTING EACH ONE OF THEM: THE FINDING REGARDING THE DELAY OF TIME IN THE JURISDICTIONAL PROCESSES, THE NEED TO NOTIFY THE STATE TO COMPLY WITH THE SENTENCES, THE GREAT PREDOMINANCE OF CIVIL MATTERS, AS WELL AS WELL AS THE RECOMMENDATION OF IMPROVEMENTS TO THE COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT NOURISHED THE EMPIRICAL SURVEY, BASED ON SOME PROBLEMS DETECTED.
171	IN THIS ARTICLE WRITTEN IN HONOUR OF DESMOND TUTU, I RAISE INCLINATION AS PUT FORWARD BY CAVARERO, TOGETHER WITH DISORIENTATION/REORIENTATION, AS PER AHMED AND HONIG, TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT LAW, RULE OF LAW, AND LEGAL CULTURE. DRAWING ON NDEBELE, KLARE AND VAN DER WALT, I CONSIDER INCLINATION AS BEING ALSO ABOUT ABANDONING THOSE VERTICAL AND UPRIGHT CERTITUDES ACQUIRED BY HABIT AND CULTURE. AN ETHICS AND ONTOLOGY OF INCLINATION COULD, BY WAY OF REFUSAL, DISCLOSE ALTERNATIVE UNDERSTANDINGS OF LAW AND RULE OF LAW. IT COULD CHALLENGE THOSE ASSUMPTIONS OF CERTAINTY AND TRUTH THAT ARE SO CENTRAL TO FORMALIST AND BLACK-LETTER TAKES ON LAW AND CURRENT LEGAL CULTURE. I RAISE INCLINATION ALSO IN THE VEIN OF A MINOR JURISPRUDENCE AND JOINING MCVEIGH AND BARR'S WRITING ON MINOR JURISPRUDENCE TO ENGAGE WITH THE QUESTION OF HOW TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR A LAWFUL LIFE, HOW TO RESPOND TO THE LEGACY OF THE PAST.
172	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE RELATION BETWEEN JUDAISM AND POLITICAL THEOLOGY IN THE WORK OF HERMANN COHEN AND FRANZ ROSENZWEIG. BOTH COHEN AND ROSENZWEIG GIVE AN INTERPRETATION OF JUDAISM THAT PRIORITIZES THE MESSIANIC IDEAL WHILE MAINTAINING THE PRIORITY OF PHILOSOPHY OVER RELIGION. WITH RESPECT TO POLITICAL THEOLOGY, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT COHEN AND ROSENZWEIG CRITICIZE THE PRIORITY ASSIGNED TO THE NATIONAL STATE IN MODERN POLITICS IN FAVOUR OF A POLITICS THAT IS BOTH COSMOPOLITAN AND REPUBLICAN, IN SO FAR AS IT MAKES THE INTERNAL RELATION BETWEEN PEOPLEHOOD AND RULE OF LAW CENTRAL, AND DETACHES THE RULE OF LAW FROM SOVEREIGNTY. IN THIS SENSE, THE MESSIANISM OF COHEN AND ROSENZWEIG IS OPPOSED TO CHRISTIAN CONCEPTIONS OF THE MESSIANIC RECOVERED IN RECENT CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH A DISCUSSION OF ROSENZWEIG'S HYPOTHESIS CONCERNING HOW THE ANTAGONISM BETWEEN THESE TWO FORMS OF MESSIANISM ARE TO BE RECONCILED IN A NEW UNDERSTANDING OF NATURAL RIGHT.
173	SAUDI ARABIA IS OFTEN DEFINED AS A COUNTRY WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS CHALLENGED BY ARCHAISM WITH REFERENCE TO ISLAMIC CRIMINAL PUNISHMENTS OR BY ANARCHY WITH REFERENCE TO ITS PLURALISM COMBINING WESTERN AND ISLAMIC LAWS (AND SOMETIMES TRIBAL CUSTOMS). BOTH OPINIONS ARE WRONG THANKS TO TWO FUNDAMENTAL RULES OF HANBALISM (THE KINGDOM'S ISLAMIC SCHOOL OF LAW). THE FIRST RULE SAYS: "NO OBEDIENCE TO A CREATURE IN THE DISOBEDIENCE OF THE CREATOR", AND THE SECOND SAYS: "THE RULE IN PROFANE ACTIVITIES (MU'AMALAT) IS LAWFULNESS UNTIL ONE INDICATION FROM THE SHARI'AH GUIDES [I.E., QUR'AN AND THE PROPHET'S SAYINGS OR HADITH] DISMISSES IT FROM [THE APPLICATION OF] THIS RULE". THANKS TO THESE RULES AND THE WAY IN WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LAW, WE WILL SEE THAT SAUDI LAW FINALLY APPEARS LESS CONTRADICTORY THAN LAWS IN OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES, AND THEREFORE LESS CHALLENGING TO THE RULE OF LAW.
174	DRAWING FROM THE RESOURCE COMPLEMENTARITY PERSPECTIVE OF THE RESOURCE-BASED VIEW OF A FIRM, THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE COMPLEMENTARY ROLE OF GOVERNANCE DIMENSIONSNAMELY, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTIONON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE IN A COUNTRY AND ITS E-GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT. BASED ON PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ARCHIVAL DATA FROM 178 COUNTRIES, OUR RESULTS PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE HYPOTHESIZED MODEL. SPECIFICALLY, WHEREAS POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND RULE OF LAW MODERATED THE RELATIONSHIP OF INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE WITH E-GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION MODERATED THE RELATIONSHIP NEGATIVELY. FURTHER, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND E-GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT WAS NOT CONTINGENT ON REGULATORY QUALITY. OUR FINDINGS CONTRIBUTE TO THE THEORETICAL DISCOURSE ON E-GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT BY HIGHLIGHTING THE COMPLEMENTARY ROLE OF GOVERNANCE AND PROVIDE SUGGESTIONS FOR PRACTICE IN MANAGING E-GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT BY ENHANCING GOVERNANCE, THEREBY LEVERAGING THE EFFECT OF INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE ON E-GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT.
175	THIS STUDY USES A STOCHASTIC FRONTIER APPROACH TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SIX GOVERNANCE INDICATORS AND AGRICULTURAL EFFICIENCY. WE FIND THAT IMPROVEMENTS IN RULE OF LAW, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS ENHANCE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY SIGNIFICANTLY IF EACH INDICATOR ENTERS THE INEFFICIENCY EQUATION INDEPENDENTLY. WHEN ALL SIX INDICATORS ARE INCLUDED IN THE EQUATION, WE FIND THAT AN IMPROVEMENT IN RULE OF LAW RAISES AGRICULTURAL EFFICIENCY SIGNIFICANTLY, BUT INCREASES IN VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND POLITICAL STABILITY APPEAR TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE AGRICULTURAL EFFICIENCY. GROUPING THE SIX INDICATORS INTO THREE DIMENSIONS, WE FIND THAT AN IMPROVEMENT IN 'RESPECT FOR INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK' RAISES AGRICULTURAL EFFICIENCY SIGNIFICANTLY, BUT AN ENHANCEMENT IN 'SELECTION OF AUTHORITY' REDUCES AGRICULTURAL EFFICIENCY SIGNIFICANTLY. OUR RESULTS IMPLY THAT POORER COUNTRIES CAN ENHANCE THEIR AGRICULTURAL EFFICIENCY SUBSTANTIALLY BY STRENGTHENING THE STATE AND CITIZENS' RESPECT FOR INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK. HOWEVER, OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT GREATER DEMOCRACY IS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER AGRICULTURAL EFFICIENCY. THIS FINDING IS CONSISTENT WITH INTEREST GROUP CAPTURE AND POLITICAL FAILURE ARGUMENTS OF THE POLITICAL ECONOMY LITERATURE.
176	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE MODES OF GOVERNMENTALITY CHARACTERISTIC OF POST-INDUSTRIAL RISK SOCIETIES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO FATALLY COMPROMISE RULE OF LAW VALUES. WHILE, POST-9/11, THE DESIRE TO PREVENT FUTURE TERRORIST ATTACKS IS ONE DRIVER OF SUCH POLICIES, POPULIST DEMANDS FOR MEASURES SUCH AS THE INDEFINITE DETENTION OF VIOLENT OFFENDERS OR THE INTRODUCTION INTO AUSTRALIA OF FORMS OF MEGAN'S LAW ARE EQUALLY POTENT FORCES. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES A VARIETY OF PHENOMENA CHARACTERISTIC OF RISK SOCIETIES, INCLUDING THE RISE OF GATED COMMUNITIES AND OTHER FORMS OF VOLUNTARY GHETTO. WHEN THE MANAGEMENT OF ANXIETIES BECOMES THE CORE OBJECT OF GOVERNMENT, THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THE PRIMACY OF THIS OBJECTIVE BOTH OVERRIDES RULE OF LAW VALUES SUCH THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AND REPLACES KEY LIBERAL VALUES, SUCH AS TOLERANCE AND RESPECT FOR THE OTHER, WITH A GREATLY EXPANDED PANOPTICON IN WHICH WE ARE ALL COMMANDED TO TAKE OUR PLACE AMONG THE WATCHERS (AND, SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE WATCHED).
177	THIS PAPER RELIES ON RICH FIRM-LEVEL DATA ON TRANSITION ECONOMIES TO EXAMINE THE ROLE OF INFORMALITY AS AN IMPORTANT CHANNEL THROUGH WHICH REGULATORY AND OTHER POLICY CONSTRAINTS AFFECT FIRM GROWTH. WE FIND THAT FIRMS REDUCE THEIR FORMAL OPERATIONS WITH GREATER TAX AND REGULATORY BURDENS, BUT INCREASE THEM WITH BETTER ENFORCEMENT QUALITY. IN TERMS OF FIRM GROWTH, WE FIND A DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT OF REGULATORY BURDEN AND ENFORCEMENT QUALITY ON FORMAL AND INFORMAL FIRM GROWTH. IN PARTICULAR, WE FIND THAT GROWTH IN FORMAL FIRMS IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY BOTH TAX AND FINANCING CONSTRAINTS, WHEREAS THESE CONSTRAINTS ARE INSIGNIFICANT FOR GROWTH IN INFORMAL FIRMS. MOREOVER, FORMAL FIRM GROWTH IMPROVES WITH BETTER ENFORCEMENT, WHILE INFORMAL FIRM GROWTH IS CONSTRAINED BY ORGANIZED CRIME, POINTING TO INFORMAL FIRMS' INABILITY TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE LEGAL AND JUDICIAL SYSTEMS. FINALLY, WE FIND THAT AN INTERACTION TERM BETWEEN A COUNTRYWIDE MEASURE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND FORMALITY IS POSITIVE, SUGGESTING THAT BETTER RULE OF LAW IMPROVES FORMAL FIRM GROWTH.
178	FRIEDRICH HAYEK DEVOTED THE LATER PART OF HIS CAREER TO INVESTIGATING THE LEGAL RULES REQUIRED FOR THE EXISTENCE OF A FREE SOCIETY. THE SUBJECT OF THIS PAPER IS HAYEK'S TREATMENT OF LEGAL POSITIVISM, WHICH HE THOUGHT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT INTELLECTUAL MOVEMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DECLINE OF LIBERAL INSTITUTIONS IN EUROPE IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY. AS SHOWN IN THE PAPER, HAYEK'S CRITIQUE CONSISTS OF TWO SEPARATE ARGUMENTS: THAT LEGAL POSITIVISM DESTROYS THE RULE OF LAW AND THAT IT AMOUNTS TO CONSTRUCTIVISM. THE FIRST CLAIM RESTS ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT "TRUE" LAWS COMPLY WITH THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE, ALTHOUGH THE MEANING OF THE ADJECTIVE TRUE IS AMBIGUOUS. THE SECOND CLAIM HOLDS ONLY FOR A PARTICULAR VARIANT OF LEGAL POSITIVISM. IN ADDITION TO DISCUSSING THESE ISSUES, THE PAPER PROVIDES AN ASSESSMENT OF HAYEK'S OWN EVOLUTIONARY THEORY OF LAW, WHICH WAS INTENDED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO BOTH LEGAL POSITIVISM AND NATURAL LAW THEORY.
179	THIS ESSAY EXPLORES THE CONSEQUENCES OF MARX'S PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT. THROUGH AN EXEGESIS OF MARX'S WORK, THIS ESSAY INDICATES HOW HE PRESENTS A HUMANIST VISION OF THE EMANCIPATION PROCESS, WITH THE AIM OF TRANSCENDING THE ECONOMIC PROCESSES OF THE MARKET AND PRIVATE PROPERTY. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE ESSAY ESTABLISHES THAT SUCH VISION RAISES TWO PROBLEMS RELATED TO POWER: FIRST, MARX DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE CHALLENGE THAT THE VORTEX OF POWER GENERATES, BY HAVING THE FREEDOM TO REASSIGN PROPERTY RIGHTS AT WILL; MAKING HIS VISION INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND THE SEPARATION OF POWER. SECOND, THE ELIMINATION OF MARKET MECHANISMS LEADS TO THE NEED FOR A RATIONAL PLANNING OF THE ECONOMY, LEADING TO BOTH THE NEED FOR CENTRAL PLANNING AND THE ARBITRARY SUBORDINATION OF INDIVIDUAL ENDS. THE ESSAY CONCLUDES BY POINTING OUT THAT BOTH PROBLEMS LEAD TO THE CONCENTRATION OF POWER, THE SUPPRESSION OF DISSENT AND THE END OF THE RULE OF LAW.
180	THE MAIN AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EMPIRICALLY EXAMINE THE ROLE OF REGIONAL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, AND COMPARE THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THREE DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS, NAMELY REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND CORRUPTION, ON PROPENSITY OF FIRM INNOVATION IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES. TO THIS END, WE USED THE MOST RECENT WORLD BANK ENTERPRISE SURVEY (WBES) OF FIRMS FROM 19 AFRICAN COUNTRIES. OUR EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION USING MULTILEVEL LOGISTIC REGRESSION HAS DRAWN THREE IMPORTANT CONCLUSIONS. FIRST, THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FIRM-SPECIFIC FACTORS, SUCH AS AGE, OWNERSHIP, AND EXPORTING, AND FIRM INNOVATION. NONETHELESS, FIRMS' PROPENSITY TO INNOVATE IS SIGNIFICANTLY DETERMINED BY THE SIZE OF THE FIRM, R&D EXPENDITURES, ON-THE-JOB TRAINING (OJT), AND CAPABILITY OF MANAGERS/OWNERS TO ADOPT NEW TECHNOLOGIES. SECOND, THE INNOVATION PERFORMANCE OF FIRMS IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY REGIONAL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. THIRD, AMONG DIFFERENT REGIONAL INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS, REDUCING CORRUPTION AND MAINTAINING RULE OF LAW APPEARED TO MATTER THE MOST FOR FIRM INNOVATION.
181	ANGLO-AMERICAN THEORIES OF CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY REQUIRE SCHOLARS TO GRAPPLE WITH, INTER ALIA, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FORMAL RULE OF LAW AND THE POWERS OF THE LAY JURY AS WELL AS TWO INHERENT IDEAS OF FREEDOM: FREEDOM OF THE WILL AND POLITICAL LIBERTY. HERE, BY WAY OF CANVASSING MY PAST WORK AND PREFIGURING FUTURE WORK, I SKETCH SOME ELEMENTS OF THE HISTORY OF THE ANGLO-AMERICAN JURY AND OFFER SOME GLIMPSES OF COMMENTARY ON THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE JURY-PARTICULARLY ITS APPLICATION OF CONVENTIONAL MORALITY TO CRIMINAL JUDGMENTS-AND THE FORMAL RULE OF LAW OF THE STATE. MY CENTRAL INTENT IS TO POSE QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY (BY MYSELF AND OTHERS) REGARDING THE HISTORICAL BEHAVIOR OF THE JURY, THE JURY'S ROLE IN REINFORCING NOTIONS OF POLITICAL LIBERTY AND FREE WILL, AND, PRIMARILY, HOW SCHOLARLY CONCEPTIONS OF THE JURY'S ROLE AND BEHAVIOR HAVE INFORMED ELITE THEORY REGARDING THE JUSTIFICATIONS FOR IMPOSING CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY.
182	THE URGENT ISSUE FACED BY THE WORLD COMMUNITY IS WHAT SHOULD BE THE ATTITUDE OF A CONSTITUTIONAL RULE-OF-LAW STATE TO THOSE WHO ARE NOT ALWAYS IN LINE WITH THE COMMONLY RECOGNIZED SOCIAL NORMS OF EVERYDAY LIVING. SHOULD IT PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS UP TO SUPPRESSING "ANTI-MODERN SECTARIANISM AND OBSCURANTISM" OR SHOULD IT EXPRESS MAXIMUM TOLERANCE TO DIFFERENT FORMS OF SOCIAL AND INDIVIDUAL ACTIVITY THAT DOES NOT FIT INTO THE TOUGH FRAMEWORKS OF THE MODERNITY PROJECT? IN THE FIRST CASE THE ENDING MIGHT BE THE "DICTATORSHIP OF HUMANISM", IN THE SECOND CASE THE RULE-OF-LAW STATE TURNS INTO THE INDIFFERENT WITNESS OF PERSONAL LIBERTY OPPRESSION. ACCORDING TO G.MUSIKHIN IT IS THE PRINCIPLE OF INDIVIDUAL AUTONOMY THAT OPENS THE WAY TO GETTING BEYOND THIS DILEMMA. HE CONCLUDES THAT THE REAL VALUE PLURALISM AND LIBERAL DEMOCRACY TOLERANCE SHOULD BE BASED ON THE SUPREMACY OF INDIVIDUAL AUTONOMY LEAVING SPACE FOR COLLECTIVE VALUES THAT DO NOT ALWAYS MEET THE PRINCIPLES OF CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERALISM.
183	WHY DO INCREASES IN GLOBALISATION IN THE FACE OF EUROPEAN EXPANSION LEAD TO SHARP LEVELS OF REGIONAL DIVERGENCES IN WEALTH IN SOME COUNTRIES BUT NOT IN OTHERS? THE CENTRAL CRUX OF THIS PAPER IS THAT CONVERGENCE/DIVERGENCE TRENDS IN EUROPEAN STATES ARE CONDITIONED BY STATE CAPACITY'. STATE CAPACITY - WHICH WE DEFINE HERE AS A COMBINATION OF IMPARTIAL BUREAUCRATIC PRACTICES, CORRUPTION AND THE RULE OF LAW - LIMITS, AND IN SOME CASES REVERSES THE TENDENCY TOWARDS GREATER DIVERGENCE LINKED TO TRADE. COUNTRIES WITH HIGH LEVELS OF STATE CAPACITY - THAT IS, THOSE THAT HAVE GREATER GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, STRONGER RULE OF LAW AND LOWER CORRUPTION - EXPERIENCE LOWER LEVELS OF DIVERGENCE, AS THEY HAVE THE MECHANISMS TO COUNTERBALANCE THE STRONG CENTRIPETAL FORCES LINKED TO OPENNESS. THIS CLAIM IS TESTED ON COUNTRIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED RELATIVELY HIGH LEVELS OF INCREASES IN LEVELS OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL GLOBALISATION - EUROPEAN UNION (EU) MEMBER STATES - USING AGGREGATED REGIONAL-LEVEL DATA FROM 1995 TO 2008. STRONG AND ROBUST EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS FOUND FOR THIS CLAIM.
184	THIS ARTICLE STUDIES THE VOLUNTARY TRANSFER OF PROPERTY THAT HAD BEEN STOLEN A TOPIC ALMOST UNEXPLORED IN THE LAW AND ECONOMICS LITERATURE. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER A BUYER OF A STOLEN GOOD SHOULD OBTAIN TITLE TO THE GOOD IF HE/SHE HAS PURCHASED IT IN GOOD FAITH. AS DESCRIBED IN THE ARTICLE DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS TREAT THIS ISSUE DIFFERENTLY. THE TRADITIONAL THEORY SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN THE COSTS OF PROTECTING THE GOOD AND THE COSTS OF VERIFYING THE OWNERSHIP. HOWEVER, AS SHOWN, THE RULE OF LAW CONCERNING THIS ISSUE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS PARTIES' INCENTIVES. SPECIFICALLY, IT IS SHOWN THAT A RULE OF LAW WHERE GOOD FAITH IS IRRELEVANT IN DETERMINING THE ISSUE OF PROPERTY RIGHTS PARETO DOMINATES A RULE WHERE GOOD FAITH MAY PROTECT AN INNOCENT BUYER. THUS, AN OWNER OF AN ASSET WILL SPEND MORE RESOURCES ON PROTECTING HIS PROPERTY AND POTENTIAL BUYERS WILL INCUR HIGHER COSTS IN ORDER TO VERIFY THE OWNERSHIP WHEN GOOD FAITH IS DECISIVE FOR THE TRANSFER OF PROPERTY RIGHTS.
185	THE RULE OF LAW IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING SIGNIFICANT EVOLUTION IN FRENCH PENAL LAW. THE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE SOURCES OF LAW PUTS INTO QUESTION THE CLASSICAL CONCEPT WHEREBY THE LAW, IN THE FORMAL SENSE OF THE WORD, HAS BEEN CONFERRED WITH A MONOPOLY WHEN IT COMES TO REPRESSION. THE APPEARANCE AND EXTRAORDINARY DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, ESPECIALLY IN EUROPEAN LAW, RE-EMERGES IN PENAL LAW. NOT ONLY DOES PENAL LAW YIELD TO COMPETITION WITH OTHER NORMATIVE SOURCES, IT HAS EVEN BECOME AN OBJECT OF REVIEW ON THE PART OF INTERNAL JUDGES AND THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THE COURT IS INCITING FRANCE TO ADOPT A MATERIAL CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT FOCUSES NO LONGER ON THE LEGITIMACY OF THE BODY ENACTING THE LEGAL NORM, BUT RATHER CONSIDERS ONLY THE SUFFICIENT QUALITY OF ITS DRAFTING. THIS EVOLUTION RAISES THE QUESTION OF THE IMPACT OF THIS NORMATIVE DISORDER ON THE COHERENCE OF THE MOVEMENT TOWARDS FURTHER PENALIZATION AND THE LEGITIMACY OF THE RIGHT TO PUNISH.
186	THE LEGAL CONCEPT OF THE CREATION OF A LEGAL ENTITY IS NOT TRAILBLAZING TERRITORY OF ITSELF, ALTHOUGH INTRODUCING AND ADVOCATING FOR THE LEGAL PERSONALITY OF A RIVER MAY BE. HOWEVER, ADVOCATING FOR THE RIGHTS OF NATURE ON GROUNDS THAT ALL HUMANS OVER-EXPLOIT, ABUSE AND CONTAMINATE THE ENVIRONMENT IS AS MISLEADING AS IT IS UNTRUE. THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES OF AUSTRALIA HAVE A PRIMARY, UNIQUE AND INHERENT OBLIGATION TO 'CARE FOR COUNTRY' ACCORDING TO THE INDIGENOUS RULE OF LAW; EXERCISING THE PROTECTION AND MANAGEMENT OF THE ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER ENVIRONMENT. THE INDIGENOUS RULE OF LAW AND THE OBLIGATION TO 'CARE FOR COUNTRY' STRETCHES BACK MANY MILLENNIA YET AUSTRALIAN DOMESTIC LAWS AND POLICIES FAIL TO PROPERLY SUPPORT THE EXERCISE OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS BY INDIGENOUS AUSTRALIANS. IN THIS ARTICLE I ARGUE, RATHER THAN EMBRACING A 'RIGHTS OF NATURE' PROPERTY PARADIGM IN AUSTRALIA, WE SHOULD INSTEAD EMPOWER FIRST NATIONS PEOPLE TO TAKE A PIVOTAL, EVEN PRIMARY, ROLE IN CARING FOR COUNTRY.
187	INVESTMENT ARBITRATIONS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN TOO OFTEN, BECAUSE THEY ARE COSTLY PROCESSES FOR BOTH PARTIES. YET THEY REGULARLY HAPPEN. WHY? WE INVESTIGATE THE HYPOTHESIS THAT INVESTMENT ARBITRATIONS ARE USED AS A MEANS OF LAST RESORT, AFTER DISSUASION HAS FAILED, AND THAT DISSUASION IS MOST LIKELY TO FAIL IN SITUATIONS WHERE SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL RISK MATERIALIZES. INVESTMENT ARBITRATION SHOULD THUS TEND TO TARGET COUNTRIES IN WHICH HIGH-POLITICAL RISK HAS MATERIALIZED. IN ORDER TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE FOCUS IN THIS ARTICLE ON TWO DRIVERS OF POLITICAL RISK: BAD GOVERNANCE AND ECONOMIC CRISES. WE TEST VARIOUS LINKS BETWEEN THESE TWO DRIVERS OF RISK AND ARBITRATION CLAIMS. WE USE AN ORIGINAL DATASET THAT INCLUDES INVESTMENT CLAIMS FILED UNDER THE RULES OF ALL ARBITRATION INSTITUTIONS AS WELL AS AD HOC ARBITRATIONS. WE FIND THAT BAD GOVERNANCE, UNDERSTOOD AS CORRUPTION AND LACK OF RULE OF LAW (USING THE WGI CORRUPTION AND WGI RULE OF LAW INDEXES), HAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RELATION WITH INVESTMENT ARBITRATION CLAIMS, BUT ECONOMIC CRISES DO NOT.
188	REGIONAL TRADE AGREEMENTS (RTAS) ALL OVER THE WORLD SHARE MANY OF THE SAME INSTITUTIONAL FEATURESFROM DISPUTE-SETTLEMENT MECHANISMS TO LEGALIZED LANGUAGE TO ESCAPE CLAUSESAND ESPOUSE MANY OF THE SAME GOALS. BUT MANY OF THOSE FEATURES ARE UNIMPLEMENTED IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS ACROSS THE WORLD. MANY OBSERVERS HAVE POINTED TO AN IMPLEMENTATION GAP IN RTASMOST OF WHICH PROMISE MUCH BUT DELIVER RELATIVELY LITTLEBUT OFFER NO EXPLANATION FOR THIS GAP. I ARGUE THAT THIS IS EXPLAINED BY DOMESTIC CAPACITY. IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS WEAK AND INFRASTRUCTURE IS INSUFFICIENTAND PARTICULARLY WHEN THOSE ELEMENTS INTERACTIT IS DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT TRADE AGREEMENTS. THIS ARTICLE UTILIZES EXPERT SURVEY DATA TO DEMONSTRATE THAT MEMBER STATES WITH POOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND LITTLE RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW ARE UNABLE TO CARRY OUT THE OBLIGATIONS THEY AGREE TO IN THEIR TRADE AGREEMENTS. DOMESTIC CAPACITYBOTH PHYSICAL AND INSTITUTIONALCAN EXPLAIN THE IMPLEMENTATION GAP BETWEEN WHAT AGREEMENTS PROMISE AND WHAT THEY DELIVER, AS WELL AS THE VARIATION IN THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THESE RTAS.
189	IN THIS ARTICLE WE ORDER THE 28 POST-COMMUNIST COUNTRIES IN A THEORETICALLY INFORMED TYPOLOGY OF POLITICAL REGIME FORMS. OUR THEORETICAL EXPECTATION IS THAT A HIERARCHY EXISTS IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE POST-COMMUNIST COUNTRIES FULFILL DEMOCRATIC CRITERIA CONCERNING ELECTORAL RIGHTS, CIVIL LIBERTIES, AND THE RULE OF LAW. MORE PARTICULARLY, WE EXPECT THAT THE COUNTRIES ARE DOING BETTER WITH RESPECT TO ELECTORAL RIGHTS THAN CIVIL LIBERTIES AND THAT THEY FARE WORST REGARDING THE RULE OF LAW. THE ANALYSES CONFIRM THREE EVER STRICTER VERSIONS OF THIS HYPOTHESIS, IN THE END ESTABLISHING THE PRESENCE OF AN ALMOST PERFECT HIERARCHY ACROSS THE ATTRIBUTES IN THE FORM OF A GUTTMAN SCALE. FURTHERMORE, A SYSTEMATIC CROSS-SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION IS IDENTIFIED, WHICH LENDS SUPPORT TO THE NOTION THAT THE PRESENT POLITICAL DIFFERENCES MUST BE TRACED BACK TO STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINTS AND ARE, THEREFORE, LIKELY TO SUBSIST.

192	ACCORDING TO AN ESSENTIALLY HOBBESIAN ACCOUNT OF POLITICAL ORDER, THE CLAIMS OF CULTURAL AND NATIONAL MINORITIES WITHIN A STATE TO SOME FORM OF CONSTITUTIONAL OR INSTITUTIONAL RECOGNITION ARE MORALLY SUSPECT AND POLITICALLY UNDESIRABLE. UNDERLYING THIS HOBBESIAN LOGIC IS A PARTICULAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATION BETWEEN LAW AND POLITICS. 'NEGATIVE CONSTITUTIONALISM' IS FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON LIMITING THE DAMAGE GOVERNMENT CAN DO. HOWEVER THE PURSUIT OF CONSTITUTIONAL MINIMALISM RUNS UP AGAINST THE CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY DEEPLY DIVERSE POLITICAL COMMUNITIES. BY INVESTIGATING THE MANNER IN WHICH HOBBES HAS BEEN INVOKED IN ARGUMENTS CONCERNING THE RELATION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE 'POLITICS OF RECOGNITION', I ARGUE (I) THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND POLITICS IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNSTABLE, AND (II) THAT IN INVOKING HOBBES, MODERN THEORISTS HAVE MISSED AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF HOBBES'S OWN ARGUMENT - NAMELY, HIS APPRECIATION OF THIS INSTABILITY. AS AN EXAMPLE, I EXAMINE THE WAY HOBBES IS USED IN SOME OF JOHN GRAY'S RECENT WRITINGS ON PLURALISM AND LIBERALISM.
193	THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO ANALYSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE IN THE CELAJ CASE. THE RULING IN QUESTION CONCERNS ITALIAN NATIONAL LEGISLATION WHICH FACILITATES THE IMPOSITION OF CRIMINAL LAW SANCTIONS ON A THIRD-COUNTRY NATIONAL WHO ILLEGALLY ENTERS THE TERRITORY OF A MEMBER STATE ACCOMPANIED BY A BREACH OF A PREVIOUS ENTRY BAN. ALTHOUGH ADVOCATE GENERAL MACIEJ SZPUNAR CLAIMED IN HIS OPINION THAT SUCH A NATIONAL PROVISION WAS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE RETURN DIRECTIVE (WHICH IS, IN PRINCIPLE, TO RETURN EVERY UNDOCUMENTED MIGRANT), THE COURT OF JUSTICE DECIDED IN THE FINAL JUDGMENT THAT THE CRIMINALISATION OF SUCH AN ILLEGAL ENTRY SHOULD BE ALLOWED. MOREOVER, IN ITS RULING, THE COURT OF JUSTICE SUGGESTS THAT AUTHORITIES SHOULD DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE FIRST ENTRY AND SUBSEQUENT ENTRIES AND THUS APPLY THE PROVISIONS OF THE DIRECTIVE ACCORDINGLY. THE AUTHOR ANALYSES AND COMPARES THE ADVOCATE GENERAL'S OPINION WITH THE FINAL JUDGEMENT OF THE COURT AND EXAMINES THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE RULING FOR EU RETURN POLICY. THE RULING IN QUESTION, WHICH, IN THE AUTHOR'S OPINION, HAS A PRECEDENT CHARACTER AND MAY RAISE CONTROVERSIES, IMPLIES A JUXTAPOSITION OF CONFLICTING VALUES: THE PRINCIPLE OF EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RETURN DIRECTIVE AS OPPOSED TO ENSURING FULL RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LAW AND OF THE PRINCIPLE OF 'NULLUM CRIMEN SINE LEGE'. BY GIVING PRIORITY TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW AND LEGAL CERTAINTY, THE COURT CLEARLY INDICATES THAT 'IT IS NOT A CRIME TO BE A FOREIGNER,' YET THE LAW IMPOSES CERTAIN RULES AND DUTIES ON FOREIGNERS, WHICH THEY MUST ABIDE BY, WHEREAS THE DUTY OF MEMBER STATES IS TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW.
194	THE DOCTRINE OF THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF A CONSTITUTION WOULD BE UNDISPUTABLE IF THOSE ELEMENTS THEREUNDER ARE CLEAR AND REPRESENTING THE FACTS OF OUR LOCAL HISTORY, NATIONHOOD, AND THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW. FORMER CHIEF JUSTICE TUN ABDUL HAMID MOHAMAD ARGUED THAT THE DOCTRINE OF THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF A CONSTITUTION INTRODUCED BY THE INDIAN SUPREME COURT CONTRADICTS ARTICLE 159 OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION AND BEYOND THE COMPETENT JURISDICTION OF THE LOCAL COURTS. HENCE, THIS ARTICLE PUTS FORWARD THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF THE BASIC STRUCTURE ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL COURT IN THE CASE OF INDIRA GANDHI TO ARTICULATE THOSE ELEMENTS SUMMED THEREIN VIEWED FROM THE WATANIC JURISPRUDENCE. THE WATANIC JURISPRUDENCE ANALYSES LEGAL DOCUMENTS AND SOURCES OF SOVEREIGNTY BASED UPON TWO PHILOSOPHICAL WORLDVIEWS; CONTINUUM AND DICHOTOMOUS FRAMEWORKS RELYING UPON THE LOCAL LEGAL HISTORY CONTEXT AND THE PRESENT LEGAL PROVISIONS OF A COUNTRY. DEPENDING ON A BROAD AND PURPOSIVE MANNER IN PROPER LINGUISTIC, PHILOSOPHIC, AND HISTORICAL CONTEXTS OF THE MALAYSIAN LEGAL HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS, THE LEGITIMATE ELEMENTS OF THE BASIC STRUCTURE ARE THE PRINCIPLE OF SOVEREIGNTY AS EMBEDDED IN THE OATH OF OFFICE OF THE YANG DI-PERTUAN AGONG TOGETHER WITH THE MATTERS AGGREGATED IN ARTICLE 38(4), ARTICLE 159(5) AND ARTICLE 161E. THE OATH OF THE YANG DI-PERTUAN AGONG THUS LEGITIMIZES SYARIAH COMPLIANCE AS THE RULE OF LAW. THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION OF MALAYSIA ALSO EXPRESSLY PROTECTS ITS BASIC STRUCTURE WITH STRICT CONDITIONAL AMENDMENTS. IN CONCLUSION, THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF OUR FEDERAL CONSTITUTION MUST BE VIEWED FROM OUR LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF CONSTITUTIONAL SUPREMACY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
195	PURPOSE THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT) IN MODULATING THE EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE ON INSURANCE PENETRATION IN 42 SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES USING DATA FOR THE PERIOD 2004-2014. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH TWO INSURANCE INDICATORS ARE USED IN THE ANALYSIS, NAMELY, LIFE INSURANCE AND NON-LIFE INSURANCE. THE THREE ICT MODULATING DYNAMICS USED INCLUDE MOBILE PHONE PENETRATION, INTERNET PENETRATION AND FIXED BROADBAND SUBSCRIPTIONS. SIX GOVERNANCE CHANNELS ARE ALSO CONSIDERED, NAMELY, POLITICAL STABILITY, "VOICE & ACCOUNTABILITY", REGULATION QUALITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, THE RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION-CONTROL. THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS BASED ON GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS. FINDINGS THE FOLLOWING MAIN FINDINGS ARE ESTABLISHED. FIRST, MOBILE PHONE PENETRATION DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY MODULATE GOVERNANCE CHANNELS TO POSITIVELY AFFECT LIFE INSURANCE WHILE IT EFFECTIVELY COMPLEMENTS "VOICE & ACCOUNTABILITY" TO INDUCE A POSITIVE NET EFFECT ON NON-LIFE INSURANCE. SECOND, INTERNET PENETRATION COMPLEMENTS GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS OF POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND RULE OF LAW TO INDUCE POSITIVE NET EFFECTS ON LIFE INSURANCE AND CORRUPTION-CONTROL FOR AN OVERALL POSITIVE EFFECT ON NON-LIFE INSURANCE. THIRD, THE RELEVANCE OF FIXED BROADBAND SUBSCRIPTIONS IN PROMOTING LIFE INSURANCE IS APPARENT VIA GOVERNANCE CHANNELS OF REGULATION QUALITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND THE RULE OF LAW WHILE FIXED BROADBAND SUBSCRIPTIONS DO NOT INDUCE SIGNIFICANT OVERALL NET EFFECTS ON NON-LIFE INSURANCE THOUGH THE CONDITIONAL EFFECTS ARE OVERWHELMINGLY SIGNIFICANT. ORIGINALITY/VALUE TO THE BEST OF THE AUTHORS' KNOWLEDGE, STUDIES ON THE RELEVANCE OF ICT IN PROMOTING INSURANCE CONSUMPTION THROUGH GOVERNANCE CHANNELS ARE SPARSE, ESPECIALLY FOR A REGION SUCH AS SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA WHERE INSURANCE PENETRATION IS LOW COMPARED TO OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD.
196	FACED WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF SOLID WASTE, CHINA AIMS TO TIGHTEN ITS WASTE MANAGEMENT REGULATION. CORRESPONDING LOCAL POLICY EXPERIMENTS ARE ENCOURAGED. THIS STUDY EXPLORES CHINA'S AUTHORITARIAN ENVIRONMENTALISM THROUGH AN EXAMINATION OF LOCAL LEGISLATIONS ON HOUSEHOLD SOLID WASTE (HSW) SORTING. WE PRESENT A FULL PICTURE OF RELEVANT LOCAL LEGISLATION FROM FIVE KEY DIMENSIONS: LOCAL LEGISLATIVE OUTPUTS, LOCAL STANDARDS OF HSW CLASSIFICATIONS, REWARD AND PENALTY PROVISIONS, THE USE OF THE SOCIAL CREDIT SYSTEM AND DUTIES IMPOSED ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WE THEN COMPARE POLICY-MAKING MODELS BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE OF SHANGHAI AND GUANGZHOU. WE FIND CHINA'S HSW SORTING POLICY HAS BEEN DOMINATED BY THE CENTRAL STATE. THE LOCAL LAWMAKING PROCESS IS GENERALLY NON-TRANSPARENT AND NON-PARTICIPATIVE. WHEN ATTEMPTING TO MOBILIZE THE PUBLIC, LOCAL POLICYMAKERS EMPHASIZE EDUCATING THE PUBLIC ABOUT "HOW TO" INSTEAD OF "WHY TO SORT WASTES". ALSO, WHILE THE CENTRAL WASTE MANAGEMENT POLICIES ARE GENERALLY UNDERMINED LOCALLY, SOME SUB-NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS DO DEMONSTRATE A STRONG COMMITMENT TO PUSH THE NATIONAL POLICY THROUGH. MULTIPLE FACTORS ACCOUNT FOR THIS PATTERN. THOUGH CIVIC ENGAGEMENT DID EMERGE IN CERTAIN LOCALITIES WHERE CIVIL SOCIETY WAS RELATIVELY ACTIVE, AUTHORITARIAN ENVIRONMENTALISM WILL CONTINUE TO PREVAIL IN CHINA IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
197	LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAVE BEEN CONFRONTED WITH THE INSTRUMENTALIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW BY PRIVATE AND PUBLIC ACTORS TO ACHIEVE UNDEMOCRATIC AIMS, THEREBY CHALLENGING THE WIDELY HELD IDEA THAT THE LAW IS CONCRETE, NORMATIVE AND OBJECTIVE IN A MANNER THAT POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES ARE NOT. AT THE SAME TIME, LAW-BASED ADVOCACY REMAINS AN EFFECTIVE MECHANISM TO COUNTER THE RISE OF STATE AND NON-STATE ACTORS WHO SEEK TO IMPEDE THE ADVANCEMENT OF PROGRESSIVE STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION TOWARD THE REALIZATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. IN ATTEMPTING TO EXPLAIN THESE CONTRADICTIONS, THE TERMS 'LAWFARE' AND 'LEGAL MOBILIZATION' HAVE GAINED PROMINENCE IN SCHOLARLY DISCUSSIONS, LARGELY IN REFERENCE TO THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS OF A PARTICULAR APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND WHOSE INTERESTS IT SEEKS TO ADVANCE. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW AS AN INSTITUTION OF POWER THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BOTH POSITIVELY AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT PROGRESSIVE SOCIAL CHANGE IN THE PURSUIT OF EXPANDING HUMAN RIGHTS. THE LITERATURE BROADLY UNPACKS THE FUNCTIONAL USE OF LEGAL MECHANISMS, STRATEGIES ASSOCIATED THEREWITH AND THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THESE COMBINED FACTORS ACHIEVE OR UNDERMINE THE INTENDED OBJECTIVES OF VARIOUS STATE AND NON-STATE ACTORS. THE PAPER PRESENTS THREE SPECIFIC STRANDS IN THE LITERATURE THAT EXPLORE: (1) HOW SOCIAL MOVEMENTS USE LAW-BASED ADVOCACY TO COUNTER (IL)LEGITIMATE FORMS OF LEGAL INSTRUMENTALISM THAT SUSTAIN HEGEMONY AND SUBSEQUENT MARGINALIZATION; (2) THE JUDICIALIZATION OF POLITICS AT THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS; AND (3) THE LEGAL CULTURE AND PRACTICES THAT GOVERN LITIGATION STRATEGIES. THE PAPER ADDRESSES THE DEBATE ACROSS A NUMBER OF THEMES, INCLUDING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RIGHTS PROTECTION, INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.
198	BACKGROUND: LEGAL EMPOWERMENT OF THE POOR IS HIGHLY RELEVANT TO PUBLIC HEALTH AS IT AIMS TO RELIEVE INCOME POVERTY, A MAIN DETERMINANT OF HEALTH. THE COMMISSION ON LEGAL EMPOWERMENT OF THE POOR (CLEP) HAS PROPOSED LEGAL EMPOWERMENT MEASURES IN THE FOLLOWING FOUR DOMAINS: ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW, PROPERTY, LABOR, AND BUSINESS RIGHTS. DESPITE BEING OVERREPRESENTED AMONG THE POOR, CLEP HAS NOT EXPLICITLY CONSIDERED THE SITUATION OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. OBJECTIVES: TO EXAMINE THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE RELEVANCE OF THE CLEP LEGAL EMPOWERMENT MEASURES TO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN LOW-AND LOWER MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES, AND TO EVALUATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES (CRPD) ADDRESSES THOSE MEASURES. METHODS: CRITICAL LITERATURE REVIEW OF EMPIRICAL STUDIES AND A CHECKLIST ASSESSMENT OF THE CRPD. RESULTS: FOURTEEN INCLUDED ARTICLES CONFIRM THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS IN THE DOMAINS OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW, LABOR RIGHTS, AND BUSINESS RIGHTS. NO TEXTS ON PROPERTY RIGHTS WERE FOUND. EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED MEASURES IS INSUFFICIENT. OVERALL, THE CRPD FULLY OR PARTIALLY SUPPORTS TWO-THIRDS OF THE PROPOSED MEASURES (SEVEN OUT OF NINE MEASURES FOR ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW, NONE OF THE FIVE MEASURES FOR PROPERTY RIGHTS, ALL SEVEN MEASURES FOR LABOR RIGHTS, AND SIX OUT OF NINE MEASURES FOR BUSINESS RIGHTS). CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE DOMAINS OF THE CLEP LEGAL EMPOWERMENT MEASURES ARE RELEVANT TO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES FROM BOTH EMPIRICAL AND NORMATIVE PERSPECTIVES, IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER THE DEVISED MEASURES ARE OF IMMEDIATE RELEVANCE TO THEM. FURTHER RESEARCH IS WARRANTED IN THIS REGARD.
199	HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL LEGAL SCHOLAR AND JUDGE RICHARD POSNER, NEWLY RETIRED FROM THE BENCH, BELIEVES THAT LAW IS IRRELEVANT TO MOST OF HIS JUDICIAL DECISIONS AS WELL AS TO MOST CONSTITUTIONAL DECISIONS OF THE US SUPREME COURT. HIS RECENT HIGH-PROFILE REPUDIATION OF THE RULE OF LAW, MADE IN STATEMENTS FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC, WAS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT HE AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN SAVING TO LEGAL AUDIENCES FOR DECADES. LEGAL PRAGMATISM HAS REACHED ITS END IN ABANDONING ALL THE RESTRAINTS OF LAW POSNER-ENDORSED "EPISTEMOLOGICAL DEMOCRACY" OBSCURES A DISCRETION THAT IS MUCH WORSE THAN THE RULE OF LAW PROMOTED BY EPISTEMOLOGICAL AUTHORITARIANISM. I ARGUE THAT A FOCUS ON CONCEPTUAL ESSENTIALISM AND ON THE RECOGNITION OF COERCIVE INTENT AS ESSENTIAL TO THE CONCEPT OF LAW, BOTH CURRENTLY UNPOPULAR AMONG LEGAL THEORISTS AND MANY JURISTS, CAN CLARIFY LEGAL UNDERSTANDINGS AND SERVE AS STARTING POINTS FOR THE RESTORATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. A MUCH MORE PRECISE, SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO LEGAL CONCEPTS IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO BEST ENSURE THE RATIONAL AND MORAL LEGITIMACY OF LAW AND TO COMBAT ERODING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN POLITICAL AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS, ESPECIALLY IN AN INCREASINGLY DIVERSE SOCIETY. THE RATIONAL REGULATION BY SOME (LAWMAKERS) OF THE REAL-WORLD ACTIONS OF OTHERS (ORDINARY CITIZENS) REQUIRES THAT CORE OR CENTRAL INSTANCES OF CONCEPTS HAVE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS RATHER THAN BE "DEMOCRATIC." ALTHOUGH LEGAL PRAGMATISM HAS FAILED JUST AS LIBERAL THEORY GENERALLY HAS FAILED, THE PRAGMATIC VALUE OF DIFFERENT CONCEPTUAL APPROACHES IS, IN FACT, THE BEST MEASURE OF THEIR WORTH. WITHOUT ESSENTIALISM IN CONCEPT FORMATION AND AN EMPHASIS ON COERCION, THE ABILITIES TO UNDERSTAND AND COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY ABOUT THE PRACTICAL LEGAL WORLD ARE IMPAIRED. ARON-ESSENTIALISM GRANTS TOO MUCH UNWARRANTED DISCRETION TO JUDGES AND OTHER LEGAL AUTHORITIES, AND THUS UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW NON-ESSENTIALIST OR ANTI-ESSENTIALIST CONCEPTUAL APPROACHES ALLOW LEGAL CONCEPTS TO TAKE ON CHARACTERISTICS APPROPRIATE TO RELIGIOUS AND LITERARY CONCEPTS, WHICH LEADS TO VAGUE AND SELF-CONTRADICTORY LEGAL CONCEPTS THAT INCOHERENTLY AND DECEPTIVELY ABSORB DISPARATE ELEMENTS THAT ARE BEST KEPT INDEPENDENT IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE LAW'S RATIONALITY AND MORAL LEGITIMACY. WHEN MADE ESSENTIALIST, THE CONCEPT OF POLITICAL POSITIVE LAW SHRINKS, CLARIFIES, AND REVEALS ITS TRUE FEATURES, INCLUDING THE PHYSICALLY-COERCIVE NATURE OF ALL LAWS AND THE VALUABLE METHOD OF TRACING THE CONTENT OF LAW BY FOLLOWING ITS COERCIVE INTENTS AND EFFECTS.
200	BY THE 1950S, THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAD LONG COMBINED WITH OTHER SYSTEMS, INSTITUTIONS, AND INDIVIDUALS TO TARGET ALL THE RESIDENTS OF EAST LA-PARTICULARLY MEXICANS-AS CRIMINALS. IN EQUATING MEXICANS WITH CRIMINALITY, THESE NETWORKED FORCES AND ACTORS REGARDED AND TREATED THESE RESIDENTS AS EXCEPTIONS-AS MORALLY REQUIRING AND LEGALLY MERITING AUTHORITARIAN RATHER THAN ACCOUNTABILITY PRACTICES. THESE PRACTICES DID NOT REQUIRE INVOCATION OF THE PRESIDENT'S EMERGENCY POWER AND DID NOT OCCUR OUTSIDE THE RULE OF LAW. INSTEAD, AUTHORITARIAN PRACTICES TARGETING EXCEPTIONS LIKE THE RESIDENTS OF 1950S EAST LA REFLECT ROUTINE CHOICES MADE FROM (AND ALWAYS AVAILABLE) WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW, MADE ACROSS ERAS AND REGIONS AND COLONIAL OUTPOSTS OF THE UNITED STATES, REPRESENTING THE PARADIGMATIC INSTANCES OF AUTHORITARIANISM IN A CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY. CONTRARY TO TIME-HONORED WISDOM, WE CANNOT ELIMINATE THE AVAILABILITY OF CLASHING CHOICES WITHIN LAW. AUTHORITARIAN PRACTICES- EVERY BIT AS MUCH AS ACCOUNTABILITY PRACTICES AT THE OTHER END OF THE SAME CONTINUUM-ARE AND SHALL REMAIN LEGALLY LEGITIMATE ACTION. CONTRARY TO PACIFYING SPEECHES, LECTURES, AND SERMONS, WE CANNOT ELIMINATE FIERCE STRUGGLES OVER RIVAL VISIONS OF THE NATIONAL COMMUNITY. EVERY DISCRETIONARY CHOICE EACH OF US MAKES WITHIN NETWORKS OF SYSTEMS, INSTITUTIONS, AND INDIVIDUALS EXPRESSES A VIEW ABOUT HOW WE WISH TO LIVE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS, THIS COUNTRY, AND ACROSS THE GLOBE, INCLUDING WHICH PEOPLE WE FEEL JUSTIFIED IN TARGETING AS EXCEPTIONS, OFTEN FOR RACIST REASONS. YET WE CAN AND SHOULD CHALLENGE AND AIM TO OBLITERATE WIDELY HAILED AND DEEPLY DELUSIONAL ORTHODOXIES ABOUT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, ABOUT NETWORKED AUTHORITARIAN PRACTICES, ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW ITSELF. THOSE WHO INSIST WE MUST REMAIN LOYAL TO THESE LIES OFFER A HORRIFIC BUT FAMILIAR ENDORSEMENT OF LIFE IN 1950S EAST LA AND OF THE CURRENT STATUS QUO. LIVING AS WE STILL DO IN THE UNITED STATES ROUTINELY DEGRADES, DEVASTATES, AND DESTROYS CERTAIN GROUPS OF PEOPLE. LIVING AS WE STILL DO REGULARLY BENEFITS CERTAIN OTHERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITHIN THE NETWORKED SYSTEMS TARGETING EXCEPTIONS AND THE BIPARTISAN MAINSTREAM ENABLERS WHO RARELY, IF EVER, PUT THEMSELVES ON THE LINE AGAINST AUTHORITARIAN PRACTICES. "ENOUGH," AS MANY PEOPLE I KNEW GROWING UP IN 1950S EAST LA WOULD SAY. "ENOUGH." LET'S UNFLINCHINGLY FACE OURSELVESAND OUR NETWORKS, INSTITUTIONS, AND SYSTEMS (INCLUDING THE RULE OF LAW IN A CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY). LET'S GET ON WITH DISCOVERING THE POSSIBILITIES AND THE LIMITS OF COEXISTENCE.
201	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE MEDIATING ROLE OF CORRUPTION IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN A SAMPLE OF 90 COUNTRIES FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM THE GLOBAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP MONITOR, WHICH DEVELOPED A MODEL WHERE CORRUPTION PERCEPTION INDEX AS A PROXY FOR CORRUPTION MEDIATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE VARIABLE RULE OF LAW AS A PROXY FOR INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND OPPORTUNITY ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A PROXY FOR PRODUCTIVE ENTREPRENEURSHIP. CORRELATION, BARON AND KENNY APPROACH (CAUSAL STEPS APPROACH) AND PROCESS MACRO (NORMAL TEST THEORY) DEVELOPED BY HAYES WERE USED TO FIND OUT THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY BETWEEN CORRUPTION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP. FINDINGS - THE BOOTSTRAP MEDIATION RESULTS INDICATED THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY WAS A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF CORRUPTION AND CORRUPTION WAS A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THESE FINDINGS SUPPORT THE MEDIATION HYPOTHESIS. IN ADDITION, FINDINGS SHOWED THAT THERE IS A NEGATIVE RELATION BETWEEN CORRUPTION AND PRODUCTIVE ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND A POSITIVE RELATION BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND PRODUCTIVE ENTREPRENEURSHIP. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE CURRENT STUDY ONLY CONSIDERED THE SINGLE PROXY FOR INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, I.E. RULE OF LAW; THEREFORE, SOME OTHER PROXIES FOR INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY SUCH AS GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND DOING BUSINESS CAN BE USED FOR FUTURE STUDIES. MOREOVER, THE PROPOSED MODEL DOES NOT CONTROL FOR THE COUNTRY DIFFERENCES LIKE GDP OR DEVELOPMENT STAGES OF COUNTRIES. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY INDICATE THAT THE TOTAL ASSOCIATION BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS NOT ONLY DIRECT BUT ALSO THAT RULE OF LAW CONTRIBUTES TO LEVELS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP THROUGH REDUCED LEVELS OF CORRUPTION. AS A RESULT, COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF RULE OF LAW TENDED TO EXPERIENCE CORRUPTION AT LOWER LEVELS, WHICH IN TURN CONTRIBUTED TO THE EMERGENCE OF INCREASED LEVELS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP. FURTHERMORE, THESE RESULTS MAY BE BENEFICIAL FOR ORGANIZATIONS FIGHTING AGAINST CORRUPTION, BECAUSE ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY CAN BE ADD TO THE GROUP OF ECONOMICAL DRIVERS CONSTRAINED BY CORRUPTION. IT IS ALSO BENEFICIAL FOR POLICY MAKERS WHO FOCUS ON PROMOTING ENTREPRENEURSHIP, SINCE ONE WAY TO INCREASE ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY IS TO LOWER THE EXISTING CORRUPTION LEVEL. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE DIRECT EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON THE ENTREPRENEURSHIP REMAINED SIGNIFICANT WHEN CONTROLLING FOR CORRUPTION, THUS SUGGESTING PARTIAL MEDIATION. IN OTHER WORDS, CORRUPTION ONLY MEDIATES PART OF THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP, THAT IS, THE INTERVENTION (INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY) HAS SOME RESIDUAL DIRECT EFFECT EVEN AFTER THE MEDIATOR (CORRUPTION) WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE MODEL.
202	THE FOOD SAFETY LAW OF CHINA, WHICH WAS UPDATED AND REVISED IN 2015, HAS CLARIFIED THE RESPONSIBILITY SYSTEM FOR THIRD-PARTY PLATFORM PROVIDERS OF THE ONLINE FOOD TRADE, WHICH PROVIDES A NEW WAY TO SUPERVISE ONLINE FOOD SAFETY IN CHINA. IT IS PIONEERING IN THE FIELD OF FOOD SAFETY IN CHINA AND EVEN WORLDWIDE. AN ANALYSIS OF THE SYSTEM IS GIVEN IN THIS ARTICLE. THE ARTICLE HOLDS THAT THERE ARE STILL ISSUES REMAINING TO BE SOLVED, INCLUDING THE AMBIGUITY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE LAW, THE LACK OF THE INTERNAL MOTIVATION OF THE THIRD-PARTY PLATFORM PROVIDER TO CARRY OUT THE DUTY OF REVIEW, AN UNCLEAR DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN THE THIRD-PARTY PLATFORM PROVIDER AND THE FOOD SAFETY SUPERVISION AUTHORITY. IN ORDER TO FURTHER PERFECT THE RESPONSIBILITY SYSTEM FOR THIRD-PARTY PLATFORM PROVIDERS, WE NEED TO PERFECT THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN ORDER TO MEND THE LEGAL LOOPHOLES, CONSTRUCT THE PREVENTION SYSTEM AND THE REWARD REPORTING SYSTEM, ADHERE TO THE CONCEPT OF "SOCIAL CO-GOVERNANCE," AND GIVE FREE REIN TO THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE THIRD-PARTY PLATFORM PROVIDER.

204	IN THIS PAPER WE CONFIRM THE HYPOTHESIS THAT CENTRAL BANK INDEPENDENCE REFORMS REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR WILL BE REPLACED. HOWEVER, THE STRENGTH OF THIS EFFECT DEPENDS ON THE RULE OF LAW AND THE DEGREE OF POLITICAL POLARIZATION. (C) 2009 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
205	AFTER AN EVENTFUL YEAR, BANGLADESH STANDS AT A CROSSROADS. ISLAMIST CHALLENGES, A CRISIS OF GOVERNANCE, AND THE ABSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW WERE THE DEFINING CHARACTERISTICS OF 2005. THE QUESTION BANGLADESHIS CAN HARDLY AVOID ANY LONGER IS: WILL THE NATION DRAG ITSELF INTO A CUL-DE-SAC?
206	JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AS A EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE - FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION OF JUDGES IN CONNECTION WITH JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE - RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING - CATALAN SECESSION CRISIS - SPANISH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT DISQUALIFICATION DOCTRINE OF MAGISTRATES - FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION OF JUDGES IN FAVOUR OF THE CATALAN SECESSIONIST MOVEMENT - SPANISH SOFT LAW ON JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE
207	CORRUPTION IS WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED TO DISTORT MARKETS, UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW, DAMAGE GOVERNMENT LEGITIMACY, AND HURT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THE GLOBAL ANTICORRUPTION MOVEMENT HAS GAINED GROUND SINCE THE MID-1990S, BUT ITS KEY AGENTS-DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND MNCS-MUST DO MORE TO PREVENT AND PUNISH MISBEHAVIOR SYSTEMATICALLY.
208	SINCE 2001, AFGHANISTAN'S ECONOMY HAS GROWN AT AN IMPRESSIVE RATE AND MAJOR DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS IN THE COUNTRY HAVE IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY. EVEN SECURITY AND THE RULE OF LAW-LONG NEGLECTED-ARE NOW IMPROVING. WASHINGTON AND ITS ALLIES COULD STILL WIN IN AFGHANISTAN IF THEY ARE GIVEN THE TIME THEY NEED.
209	PURPOSE THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXAMINE THE ADEQUATE APPLICATION OF RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES UNDER LABOR LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO FOREIGN EMPLOYEES WORKING IN CHINA. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE AUTHORS ANALYZED APPLICABLE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RELATED LITERATURE ON THE EMPLOYMENT OF FOREIGNERS IN CHINA AND EMPLOYED QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE METHODS TO SCRUTINIZE THE FEATURES OF LABOR DISPUTES INVOLVING FOREIGN EMPLOYEES, TO ASSESS CLAIMS OF INCONSISTENCIES. A GROUP OF JUDGES AND LABOR ARBITRATORS WERE ALSO INTERVIEWED. FINDINGS THE INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN CHINESE IMMIGRATION AND LABOR LAWS, AND BETWEEN APPLICABLE LAWS AND COURT ENFORCEMENT, RESULT IN A CONSIDERABLE GAP IN EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION FOR FOREIGN EMPLOYEES. THEY HAVE GROWN OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, IN A CHANGING LEGAL ENVIRONMENT OF LABOR PROTECTION AND LABOR MARKET FOR FOREIGNERS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THIS STUDY FOCUSED ON DOCUMENTED FOREIGN EMPLOYEES' LABOR LITIGATIONS FROM 2017 TO 2020 IN PEOPLE'S COURTS IN CHINA'S FIVE MOST ECONOMICALLY DEVELOPED REGIONS. FUTURE STUDIES COULD COVER A WIDER GEOGRAPHIC TERRITORY AND LABOR DISPUTES OF UNDOCUMENTED FOREIGN EMPLOYEES TO PROVIDE AN EVEN MORE COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF THE CHALLENGES AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THE INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN IMMIGRATION AND LABOR LAW REGARDING EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION FOR DOCUMENTED FOREIGN EMPLOYEES REQUIRES LEGAL CLARIFICATION AND REGULATION TO ENSURE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION OF BOTH CHINESE AND FOREIGN EMPLOYEES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THERE ARE LIMITED STUDIES USING EMPIRICAL DATA FROM DIFFERENT REGIONS IN CHINA TO DOCUMENT AND UNDERSTAND THE GAP BETWEEN THE STATUTORY LABOR PROTECTIONS AND THE LABOR PROTECTION GRANTED TO FOREIGN EMPLOYEES IN LAW AS WELL AS IN COURT PRACTICE.
210	JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN THE CONTEXT OF RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING - A SYSTEMATISATION OF CASE LAW FROM THE COURT OF JUSTICE AND THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS - CLASSIC DIMENSIONS OF OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE INDEPENDENCE OF JUDGES - A NEW THIRD DIMENSION: THE RIGHT OF JUDGES TO THEIR OWN INDEPENDENCE AS FINAL SAFEGUARD
211	AGAINST THOSE THESES STATING THAT KANT OFFERS IMPOVERISHED, UNORIGINAL OR TIMOROUS VERSIONS OF REPUBLICANISM, TOLERANCE AND ENLIGHTENMENT, IN THIS PAPER I ARGUE THAT SUCH KANTIAN VERSIONS ARE, REGARDLESS HOW NUANCED, BASICALLY BIASED, AND THEY ARE ULTIMATELY BASED ON THE CO-IMPLICATION BETWEEN MORALITY AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND REPUBLICAN RULE OF LAW.
212	DOES INTERNATIONAL LAW RESTRICT THE USE OF FORCE BY STATES IN SELF-DEFENSE EVEN WHEN THEIR SURVIVAL IS THREATENED? SHOULD IT? TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, I COMPARE INTERNATIONAL LAW TO DOMESTIC LAW AND DEVELOP TWO IDEAL-TYPES OF EMERGENCY: IN A 'SUBJECT EMERGENCY' LAW IMPOSES ABSOLUTE, JUSTICIABLE LIMITS ON SELF-DEFENSE. IN A 'COMMUNITY EMERGENCY' THE SOVEREIGN, NOT LAW, DETERMINES WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR THE SURVIVAL OF THE COMMUNITY AND ITS LEGAL SYSTEM: SUSTAINING THE RULE OF LAW JUSTIFIES ITS TEMPORARY RETREAT. I SHOW THAT INTERNATIONAL LAW HAS ELEMENTS OF BOTH IDEAL-TYPES. IT IMPOSES SOME ABSOLUTE LIMITS ON SELF-DEFENSE. HOWEVER, INTERNATIONAL LAW ALSO RETREATS, ALLOWING THE VICTIM STATE TO DETERMINE THE (1) AIMS, (2) AD BELLUM PROPORTIONALITY, AND (3) END OF SELF-DEFENSE, AS IF ARMED THREATS TRIGGERED COMMUNITY EMERGENCIES. THESE THREE RETREATS SERVE THE FUNCTION OF SUSTAINING THE RULE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW OVER THE STATES AT WAR. RETREATS (1) AND (3) ALSO HELP SUSTAIN THE RULE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW OVER THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. THAT INTERNATIONAL LAW DOES AND SHOULD NOT TREAT ARMED THREATS AGAINST STATES SIMPLY AS SUBJECT EMERGENCIES, SHOWS IT CAN ONLY SUSTAIN THE RULE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IN AN EMERGENCY BY RETREATING. THIS IS A NEGATIVE LITMUS TEST FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW'S ABILITY TO DIFFUSE ANARCHY IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.
213	AS POLISH PHILOSOPHER LESZEK KOLAKOWSKI MAINTAINS, THE ULTIMATE CAUSE FOR THE SUPREMACY OF STALINIST TOTALITARIANISM WAS THE COMPLETE LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW? THIS BRIEF LOOK AT THE SITUATION IN BULGARIA - A FORMER COMMUNIST STATE GIVES US A CASE IN POINT OF THE CONTINUING RESIDUE FROM THAT HISTORY.
214	SOCIALIST OBJECTIVES CAN BE ACHIEVED IN A MARKET CONTEXT WITH THE RULE OF LAW IF MARKET SOCIALISM WERE TO TAKE THE FORM OF COMPETITIVE WORKER-OWNED AND SELFMANAGED ENTERPRISES, SUPPLEMENTED BY UNIVERSALLY AVAILABLE WELFARE REDISTRIBUTIONS, WHICH COULD INCLUDE A BASIC INCOME, UNIVERSAL CAPITAL GRANTS, OR EDUCATION AND HEALTH INSURANCE VOUCHERS.
215	THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RURAL REVITALIZATION STRATEGY IS AN IMPORTANT STRATEGIC PLAN TO SOLVE THE SOCIAL "THREE RURAL" PROBLEMS ON THE NEW ROAD OF BUILDING A SOCIALIST MODERNIZED COUNTRY IN AN ALL-ROUND WAY. IT IS ALSO THE CURRENT SOCIETY TO PROMOTE THE COMPREHENSIVE RULE OF LAW AND TO CREATE AND IMPROVE A MODERN RURAL SOCIAL GOVERNANCE SYSTEM UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE PARTY COMMITTEE, THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE, THE SOCIETY IS COORDINATED, AND THE COUNTRY IS GOVERNED BY LAW. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE WIDE DISTRIBUTION OF RURAL AREAS AND THE LARGE POPULATION BASE OF FARMERS, THERE ARE MANY RISKS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RURAL REVITALIZATION STRATEGY. IN THE COMPREHENSIVE USE OF ECONOMIC, ADMINISTRATIVE, AND LEGAL MEANS, LEGAL MEANS HAS BECOME THE KEY. FOR THIS REASON, THIS ARTICLE CONDUCTED IN-DEPTH RESEARCH ON THE LEGAL PATH OF RURAL REVITALIZATION UNDER THE RISK PREVENTION OF INTERNET OF THINGS ALGORITHM DECISION-MAKING. THE RESEARCH RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE RISK PREVENTION OF INTERNET OF THINGS ALGORITHM DECISION-MAKING WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE RESEARCH ON THE LEGAL PATH OF RURAL REVITALIZATION, AND A SOUND RURAL GOVERNANCE SYSTEM THAT COMBINED AUTONOMY, RULE OF LAW, AND MORALITY IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE REVITALIZATION OF SEVEN VILLAGES. IT CAN IMPROVE THE 2.67% EFFECTIVENESS OF RISK PREVENTION IN DECISION-MAKING AND CAN ALSO PLAY A KEY ROLE IN RULING THE COUNTRY ACCORDING TO LAW, SHOWING THE CORRECT DIRECTION OF AGRICULTURAL LEGAL SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION AND AT THE SAME TIME HIGH-LEVEL RURAL CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT UNDER THE FRAMEWORK OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT WILL VIGOROUSLY PROMOTE THE COMPREHENSIVE MODERNIZATION OF AGRICULTURE, THE COMPREHENSIVE PROGRESS OF RURAL AREAS, AND THE REVITALIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL AREAS.
216	THE DEBATE OVER COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM IS COMPLEX, AND JEWS AND CHRISTIANS HOLD VARYING OPINIONS ON HOW TO TREAT FOREIGNERS, BOTH LEGAL AND ILLEGAL.(1) AN AUTHENTIC JUDEO-CHRISTIAN APPROACH TO REFORM SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE CONTEXT OF THE SCRIPTURES, RESPECT THE RULE OF LAW, AND REASSESS WHAT IS MEANT BY THE WORD "COMPREHENSIVE."
217	MANY FINANCIAL CRISES DURING THE LAST DECADE HAVE DERIVED MORE DIRECTLY FROM POLITICAL THAN PURELY ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. WHEN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY, REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OR THE RULE OF LAW BREAK DOWN, THE LIKELIHOOD THAT POLITICIANS WILL IMPLEMENT UNSUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC POLICIES RISES. THE ECONOMICS LITERATURE ANALYSES THE ROLE OF POORLY FUNCTIONING GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS IN ALLOWING A NATION TO SLIP INTO FINANCIAL CRISIS. HOWEVER, THE LITERATURE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF POST-CRISIS REFORMS FOCUSES ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON WHETHER THE STATED POST-CRISIS POLICIES ARE APPROPRIATE FROM AN ECONOMIC VIEWPOINT. ODDLY, THAT LITERATURE FAILS TO EXAMINE THE STATUS OF THE UNDERLYING GOVERNMENTAL DEFICIENCIES, ASSUMING IMPLICITLY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN REMEDIED. BECAUSE ECONOMIC REFORMS ARE FEASIBLE ONLY WITH WIDE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONSENSUS, TWO IMPORTANT POST-CRISIS ISSUES ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF SUCH REFORMS; NAMELY, THE POLITICAL SITUATION AND POLITICIANS' MANAGEMENT OF ECONOMIC POLICY. POLITICAL FAILURES ARE PARTICULARLY RELEVANT TO THE ARGENTINE FINANCIAL CRISIS THAT BEGAN IN DECEMBER 2001. THIS PAPER IDENTIFIES THOSE POLITICAL ISSUES, WHICH DERIVED FROM AN UNSTABLE POLITICAL STRUCTURE CHARACTERIZED BY CORRUPTION AND FRAGMENTED POWER BETWEEN PROVINCES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. CRITICALLY, THE RULE OF LAW HAD BEEN UNDERMINED IN 1991. INTERESTINGLY, THESE SAME SHORTCOMINGS STILL PERVADED ARGENTINA IN 2004. THE RESULTANT LACK OF POLITICAL CONSENSUS CONTINUES TO DELAY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STRUCTURAL REFORMS NECESSARY TO RETURN TO SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH. SOCIAL CONFIDENCE IN THE GOVERNMENT IS LOW; THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE SUPREME COURT HAS BEEN SHATTERED; AND THE RULE OF LAW CONTINUES TO BE ERODED, AS THE GOVERNMENT TRAMPLES ON THE PROPERTY RIGHTS OF PRIVATE FIRMS AND PUBLIC DEBT-HOLDERS. BECAUSE IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT ARGENTINA CAN OVERCOME ITS POLITICAL DEFICIENCIES IN THE NEAR FUTURE, ITS PROSPECTS FOR FULL ECONOMIC RECOVERY ARE LIMITED, REGARDLESS OF WHICH ECONOMIC REFORMS IT IMPLEMENTS.
218	PURPOSE INTERNATIONAL BODIES, SUCH AS THE FINANCIAL ACTION TASK FORCE , HAVE MANDATED THE USE OF FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE UNITS (FIU) TO ADDRESS ORGANIZED CRIME AND MONEY LAUNDERING. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE CANADA'S FIU, THE FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS AND REPORTS ANALYSIS CENTRE OF CANADA (FINTRAC), AND EXPLORE ITS CURRENT EFFECTIVENESS AND FUTURE CHALLENGES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS PAPER EXAMINES FIUS IN GENERAL AND THEN LOOKS MORE SPECIFICALLY AT CANADA'S FIU, ITS POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE BASIS AS WELL AS FUTURE CHALLENGES FOR THE FIU. FINDINGS THE CHALLENGE MONEY LAUNDERING POSES TO SOCIETY IS A MIRROR OF THE CHALLENGE THAT ORGANIZED CRIME POSES: A TEST OF THE VALUES AND THE IMPORTANCE OF RULE OF LAW. THE FIU IS AN IMPORTANT MECHANISM TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE GENERALLY, AND THERE ARE IMPORTANT CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED IF THE FUTURE POLICY OBJECTIVES OF THE FIU ARE TO BE MET. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS SOME OF THE POLICY NOSTRUMS THAT ARE BAKED INTO THE ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING SYSTEM, SUCH AS PLACEMENT, LAYERING AND INTEGRATION, NEED TO BE REVISITED AND RESEARCHED TO INCORPORATE CHANGES IN THE LICIT AND ILLICIT MARKETPLACES. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER INTERMEDIARIES MUST COMPLY WITH DOMESTIC ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LAWS. COMPLIANCE IS ALWAYS CONTEXTUAL, AND THIS PAPER WILL OUTLINE THE ROLE OF THE REGULATOR AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES THAT NEED TO BE MET. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSING MONEY LAUNDERING AND ORGANIZED CRIME IS CRITICAL TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RULE OF LAW AND THE PROTECTION OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS IS A BRIEF BUT VERY FULSOME REVIEW OF CANADA'S FIU, FINTRAC, WHICH CAPTURES BROADER CHALLENGES IN ADDRESSING MONEY LAUNDERING, ECONOMIC CRIME AND REGULATORY SYSTEMS DESIGNED TO PROTECT RULE OF LAW AND THE INTEGRITY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. THE PAPER NOT ONLY EXAMINES THE CURRENT STATE OF THE FIU BUT ALSO EXPLORES CHALLENGES ON THE HORIZON.
219	THE DECREASE IN JOURNALIST SAFETY AND MEDIA FREEDOM HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE RULE OF LAW BECAUSE JOURNALISTS CANNOT ACT AS PUBLIC WATCHDOGS. ITS DETERIORATION IN EUROPE DURING THE LAST DECADE IS A WORRYING TREND FOR SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE HAS TRIED TO FIGHT AGAINST IT THROUGH THE CREATION OF A PUBLIC INTERNET-BASED PLATFORM FOR THE PROTECTION OF JOURNALISM AND THE SAFETY OF JOURNALISTS. THE PLATFORM RECEIVES ALERTS FROM NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS JOURNALIST ASSOCIATIONS AND THIS SERVES AS AN EARLY WARNING MECHANISM FOR THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE. NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS ACT AS PARTNERS OF THIS INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION AND IN THAT WAY THEY PROTECT THE RULE OF LAW FROM BELOW. A SIMPLE SEARCH OF THE PLATFORM PERMITS TO SEE THE MANY THREATS JOURNALISTS FACE IN EUROPE EVERY DAY. THIS PAPER ASSESSES HOW THE PLATFORM WORKS. IT IS A POSITIVE INITIATIVE TO CO-OPERATE WITH CIVIL SOCIETY THAT STILL HAS TO IMPROVE ITS RESULTS MAINLY THROUGH A MORE EFFECTIVE ENGAGEMENT OF THE MEMBER STATES OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE.
220	THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A NEW CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING TRANSPARENCY AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL. IT IDENTIFIES THREE DISTINCT INTERPRETATIONS OF TRANSPARENCY: ACCESS TO INFORMATION; TWO-WAY COMMUNICATION; AND PREDICTABILITY, OR DECISION-MAKING BASED ON CLEAR AND PUBLICLY KNOWN RULES. EACH REPRESENTS AN INCREASINGLY DEMANDING FORM OF TRANSPARENCY, BUT ALL ARE TIED TO DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW. USING THE CASE OF ROMANIA, THE ARTICLE ILLUSTRATES HOW SUCH A FRAMEWORK CAN BE EMPLOYED TO ASSESS THE EVOLUTION OF TRANSPARENCY IN A RELATIVELY RECENT DEMOCRACY. POINTS FOR PRACTITIONERS THE VIRTUES OF TRANSPARENCY HAVE BEEN ADVOCATED BY INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, GOVERNMENTS, AND CIVIL SOCIETY. THE FOCUS HAS PRIMARILY BEEN ON ACCESS TO INFORMATION-WHETHER THROUGH FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACTS OR OPEN DATA. HOWEVER, REALIZING THE DEMOCRATIZING POTENTIAL OF TRANSPARENCY REQUIRES A MULTIFACETED APPROACH. THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT TRANSPARENCY ADVOCATES SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION TO ISSUES SUCH AS INCREASING CITIZEN PARTICIPATION, OPENING UP DECISION-MAKING RATHER THAN JUST DATA, STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW, AND FIGHTING CORRUPTION. IN OTHER WORDS, IT ARGUES FOR A MORE HOLISTIC DISCOURSE AND PRACTICE OF TRANSPARENCY.
221	WE EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF A COUNTRY'S GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT ON THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT IT ATTRACTS. WE CLASSIFY COUNTRIES BASED ON THE DOMINANT MODE OF GOVERNANCE INTO THREE TYPES: (1) RULE-BASED (STRONG PUBLIC RULE OF LAW), (2) RELATION-BASED (WEAK RULE OF LAW AND STRONG INFORMAL NETWORKS), AND (3) FAMILY-BASED (ABSENCE OF BOTH PUBLIC RULES AND INFORMAL NETWORKS). WE THEN EXAMINE HOW DIFFERENT GOVERNANCE TYPES AFFECT FOREIGN INVESTMENT PATTERNS AMONG 45 COUNTRIES. OUR MAIN ARGUMENT IS THAT THE CHOICE OF INVESTMENT-DIRECT OR PORTFOLIO-IS INFLUENCED BY THE TYPE OF PROPERTY PROTECTION ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT GOVERNANCE MODES. WE FIND THAT RULE-BASED COUNTRIES ATTRACT THE LOWEST AMOUNT OF FDI RELATIVE TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT, AND THEY HAVE THE LARGEST STOCK MARKET SIZE RELATIVE TO THEIR ECONOMIES. OUR STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT LITERATURE BY BRINGING THE GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT INTO THE EQUATION AND MORE SUCCESSFULLY EXPLAINING WHY SOME COUNTRIES HAVE RELATIVELY LARGE FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT RATIOS AND RELATIVELY SMALL FOREIGN PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT RATIOS.
222	STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW AND PROMOTING ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN LONGSTANDING INTERNATIONAL POLICY OBJECTIVES. HOWEVER, THE STANDARD POLICY TOOLS, SUCH AS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND MATERIAL AID, ARE ROUTINELY CRITICIZED FOR FAILING TO ACHIEVE THEIR OBJECTIVES. THE RARE EXCEPTION IS PARALEGAL AID, WHICH IS ALMOST UNIVERSALLY LAUDED BY POLICYMAKERS AND SCHOLARS AS EFFECTIVE IN PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE. THIS BELIEF, HOWEVER, RESTS ON A VERY LIMITED EMPIRICAL FOUNDATION REGARDING WHAT PARALEGAL PROGRAMS ACCOMPLISH AND UNDER WHAT THEORY THEY OPERATE. THIS PAPER CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM SURROUNDING PARALEGAL INITIATIVES THROUGH CASE STUDIES OF TWO SUCCESSFUL PARALEGAL PROGRAMS IN POST-CONFLICT TIMOR-LESTE THAT ARE BROADLY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE TYPE OF INITIATIVES COMMONLY IMPLEMENTED IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THESE PROGRAMS DID IMPROVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE SERVICES, BOLSTER CHOICE BETWEEN DISPUTE RESOLUTION FORUMS, AND INCREASE LOCAL KNOWLEDGE OF PROGRESSIVE NORMS ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS. YET, AS THIS ARTICLE SHOWS, EVEN SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS CAN EXPECT TO ACHIEVE ONLY INCREMENTAL GAINS IN PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW BECAUSE ADVANCES LARGELY DEPEND ON ALIGNMENT WITH THE PRIORITIES OF POWERFUL STATE AND NON-STATE ACTORS, DONORS, PROGRAM IMPLEMENTERS, AND PARALEGALS THEMSELVES. TO DATE, THE LITERATURE HAS NOT ACKNOWLEDGED THESE LIMITATIONS. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THIS GAP BY DEMONSTRATING THAT PARALEGAL AID FACES MULTIPLE CHALLENGES THAT MEAN PARALEGALS CANNOT NECESSARILY TRANSCEND OR MODIFY DEEP SEATED NORMS AND POWER STRUCTURES. THESE ISSUES INCLUDE PRINCIPAL AGENT-PROBLEMS DUE TO THE EXTENSIVE DELEGATION REQUIRED, INTERNAL LIMITATIONS RESULTING FROM PARALEGALS' LIMITED AUTHORITY AND INDEPENDENCE, AND EXTERNAL CONSTRAINTS FROM STATE AND NON-STATE JUSTICE ACTORS. PARALEGAL PROGRAMS ALSO FACE PROGRAM DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND SUSTAINABILITY CHALLENGES. CONSEQUENTLY, SCHOLARS, PRACTITIONERS, AND POLICYMAKERS NEED TO ADOPT A MORE BALANCED VIEW OF PARALEGAL AID. (C) 2018 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
223	AFTER 9/11, JUSTICE JOHN PAUL STEVENS INSISTED THE UNITED STATES MAINTAIN ITS FOUNDATIONAL COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW-THE VERY "ESSENCE OF A FREE SOCIETY." JUSTICE STEVENS LED THE COURT'S SCRUTINY AND REJECTION OF EARLY BUSH ADMINISTRATION POLICIES REGARDING THE DETENTION AND PROSECUTION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. SINCE IT LOST JUSTICE STEVENS'S PASSIONATE AND PRINCIPLED VOICE IN 2008, THE COURT HAS NOT ADDRESSED THE SCOPE OF THE PRESIDENT'S MILITARY DETENTION AUTHORITY. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS JUSTICE STEVENS'S ROLE IN THE COURT'S ALTERED STANCE, AND ALSO A COMPLEMENTARY EXPLANATION: THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S IMPROVED INTERPRETATION AND EXERCISE OF EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY. INFORMED AND INSPIRED BY JUSTICE STEVENS'S JURISPRUDENCE, A POST-9/11 ACADEMIC DEBATE EXPLORES THE DEFERENCE DUE THE EXECUTIVE'S STATUTORY AND TREATY INTERPRETATIONS ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS MATTERS, APPROPRIATELY FAVORING AN INTERMEDIATE MEASURE OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS DEFERENCE THAT PROVIDES A MEANINGFUL JUDICIAL CHECK WHILE RESPECTING THE EXECUTIVE'S CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY AND EXPERTISE. THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S EXTRAORDINARILY FLAWED THEORY AND OFTEN SECRET CLAIMS OF AUTHORITY TO CONTRAVENE FEDERAL STATUTES THAT EFFECTIVELY FORFEITED ITS CLAIM TO JUDICIAL DEFERENCE. PREVAILING NARRATIVES THAT EMPHASIZE CONTINUITY-BETWEEN THE BUSH AND OBAMA POLICIES AS WELL AS PRESIDENTIAL POWER AGGRANDIZEMENTS-UNDERAPPRECIATE THE UNUSUAL, ARGUABLY UNIQUE, NATURE OF THE BUSH APPROACH'S THREAT TO THE RULE OF LAW. FUTURE JUDICIAL REVIEW OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS MATTERS MIGHT NOT BE AS ROBUST AS SOME HOPE AND OTHERS FEAR. ONLY THE COMBINATION OF JUDICIAL REVIEW AND CONTINUED VIGILANCE FROM NONJUDICIAL SOURCES CAN EFFECTIVELY CHECK THE EXECUTIVE DURING TIMES OF WAR AND CRISIS. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY BRIEFLY ASSESSING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PERFORMANCE ON RULE-OF-LAW ISSUES THAT MIGHT NEVER FACE JUDICIAL REVIEW.
224	THIS PAPER WAS INVITED AS A COMMENTARY ON THE KEYNOTE PAPER FOR THIS SPECIAL ISSUE BY SIMON MARGINSON AND LILI YANG. THE PAPER BEGINS BY NOTING THE IMPORTANCE OF A FULLY BALANCED APPROACH TO COMPARISON IN HIGHER EDUCATION, THAT GIVES EQUAL VALUE AND WEIGHT TO SINIC AND ANGLO-AMERICAN VIEWS BY ADOPTING A TRANSPOSITIONAL APPROACH AND ALSO RECOGNISING THE LINGUISTIC CHALLENGES INVOLVED. IT THEN CONSIDERS STRENGTHS OF THE SINIC APPROACH AND OF THE CONTRASTING ANGLO-AMERICAN APPROACH AND THEIR OUTCOMES OVER HISTORY, USING A FRAME DRAWN FROM RECENT WORK BY FRANCIS FUKUYAMA. FINALLY IT TURNS TO WEAKNESSES ON BOTH SIDES, AND WAYS IN WHICH LEARNING FROM THE OTHER COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
225	SOME EXPRESSIONS IDENTIFY THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER WITH THE "RULES OF THE GAME" OR "OF THE CONVIVENCE". TAKING THAT AS A STARTING POINT, SOME KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDERS ARE POINTED OUT, BY COMPARING THEM WITH THE RULES OF THE GAMES. FREEDOM, LUDIC CHARACTER AND LACK OF PUNISHMENT TO THOSE WHO DECIDE NOT TO PLAY ARE CONFRONTED TO SUPPOSED SHARED CONSENT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS, SACREDNESS AND POTENTIAL USE OF UNREGULATED VIOLENCE AGAINST DISSIDENCE. FROM THAT CHARACTERIZATION SOME CRITICAL COMMENTS WILL BE MADE.
226	OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO LINK THE PRINCIPLED TRILEMMATIC NATURE OF THE EFFICIENCY, SOLIDARITY AND UNIVERSALITY OF THE COMPREHENSIVE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM IN THE FACE OF INFORMALITY IN THE COLOMBIAN TERRITORY, WHICH IGNORES THE MINIMUM CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL GUARANTEES PROVIDED BY THE SOCIAL STATE OF LAW IN THE DEFENSE AND PROTECTION OF RIGHTS INHERENT TO THE HUMAN CONDITION. SOCIAL SECURITY HAS A FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTER IN THE SOCIAL STATE OF LAW THAT CONTRASTS WITH REALITY AND, SPECIFICALLY, IN THE LABOR AND SOCIAL SECURITY CONTEXT OF THE INFORMAL SECTOR. INFORMALITY IN COLOMBIA IS A REFLECTION OF SOCIAL INJUSTICE AND INEQUALITY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE PHENOMENON OF GLOBALIZATION AND LABOR FLEXIBILITY THAT LEADS TO INCREASING JOB INSECURITY, SINCE THE STATE RESTRICTS AND LIMITS RIGHTS WITH SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF PUBLIC POLICY OF EXCLUSION, PRIMACY OF THE NEOLIBERAL ECONOMIC MODEL AND PREVAILING LEGALISM. METHODOLOGY: THE APPLIED RESEARCH MODEL IS CHOSEN AS A RESEARCH REFERENCE WHEN IT IS CORRELATED WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES OF KNOWLEDGE AND REALITIES THAT ARE ARTICULATED WITH THE SOCIAL SCIENCES. A LEGAL PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACH IS ASSUMED THAT SEEKS THE ANALYSIS OF LEGAL NORMS, THEIR CORRESPONDENCE OR DISCREPANCY IN THE FACE OF THE SET OF VALUES AND PRINCIPLES OF SOCIETY, BY DETERMINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW AND JUSTICE AS THE CENTRAL AXIS OF THE INVESTIGATION. CONCLUSION: INFORMALITY NEEDS TO BE ANALYZED, RECONSTRUCTED AND INTERPRETED FROM THE PHILOSOPHY OF LAW BY REDEFINING LABOR LAW AND SOCIAL SECURITY AS INHERENT RIGHTS OF MAN.
227	THIS ANALYTICAL ESSAY IS A SHORT INVESTIGATION INTO THE NARRATIVE THAT THERE ARE NEW "ROUGE STATES'' IN CENTRAL EASTERN EUROPE (CEE), NAMELY POLAND AND HUNGARY. THE TEXT DISCUSSES THE POLITICALLY RELEVANT BACKGROUNDS AS WELL AS PROS AND CONS OF SUCH AN IMAGINARY AND THE PERSPECTIVES IN THE FRAMEWORK OF EUROPE'S CURRENT CRITICAL TRANSITION.
228	WHEN, ON DECEMBER 7, 2000, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL AND THE COMMISSION PROCLAIMED SOLEMNLY IN NICE THE CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, MANY THOUGHT THAT EUROPEAN INTEGRATION WAS PRACTICALLY GUARANTEED AND THAT THE CHARTER WOULD SOON BE MADE INTO A BINDING LEGAL TEXT. SINCE THEN, THE TWO ATTEMPTS TO ENACT A EUROPEAN CONSITUTION - THE CONSTITUTIONAL TREATY FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION OF 2004 AND THE ARGUABLY LESS AMBITIOUS TREATY OF LISBON OF 2007 - BOTH FAILED. FURTHER EFFORTS AT UNIFICATION HAVE STAGNATED, IN PART DUE TO THE 2008 ECONOMIC CRISIS AND THE EUROPEAN UNION'S INABILITY TO COORDINATE RESPONSES TO ISSUES AS SERIOUS AS IMMIGRATION, THE REFUGEE CRISIS, AND TERRORISM. IN THIS PAPER, I EXAMINE A THEORETICAL COUNTERPOINT TO THAT BLEAK PERSPECTIVE FOR EUROPEAN UNIFICATION, TO WIT, JURGEN HABERMAS' EUROFEDERALIST PROPOSAL OF THE POSTNATIONAL DEMOCRACY AND EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONAL PATRIOTISM.
229	MARKUS LAMMERT, THE FRENCH LEFT, TERRORISM AND THE "REPRESSIVE STATE" IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC DURING THE 1970S THE WEST GERMAN "INTERNAL SECURITY" POLICY OF THE 1970S WAS HARSHLY CRITICISED IN FRANCE. IN MANY SECTIONS OF THE FRENCH LEFT, THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC WAS SEEN AS A STATE WHICH WAS ABOLISHING THE RULE OF LAW IN ITS STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM. MARKUS LAMMERT TRACES THE DIFFERENT RESPONSES OF THE FRENCH CRITICS, AMONG THEM LEFT-WING EXTREMISTS AS WELL AS LEFT-LIBERAL POLITICIANS, WHO WERE SOON TO MOVE INTO GOVERNMENT POSITIONS. THEIR MOTIVES CANNOT BE REDUCED TO A HISTORICALLY FOUNDED "ANTI-GERMANISM". MOSTLY, THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC AND ITS STRUGGLE WITH TERRORISM SERVED AS A PROJECTION SCREEN FOR INTERNAL POLITICAL CONFLICTS WITHIN FRANCE ITSELF. THE EXTENSION OF THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN THE FIFTH REPUBLIC, EXTENDED CIVIL LIBERTIES AND IMPROVED HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTIONS WERE AMONG THE CENTRAL THEMES OF THE FRENCH LEFT DURING THE 1970S. ADDITIONALLY TRANSNATIONAL GERMAN-FRENCH NETWORKS FOSTERED CROSS-BORDER PROTEST MOBILISATION AGAINST THE ANTI-TERRORISM POLICY OF THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT.
230	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES HOW THE RULE OF LAW (I.E. LAW) MODULATES DEMAND- AND SUPPLY-SIDE DRIVERS OF MOBILE MONEY TO INFLUENCE MOBILE MONEY INNOVATIONS (I.E. MOBILE MONEY ACCOUNTS, THE MOBILE PHONE USED TO SEND MONEY AND THE MOBILE PHONE USED TO RECEIVE MONEY) IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS FROM TOBIT REGRESSIONS ARE ESTABLISHED. FIRST, FROM THE DEMAND-SIDE LINKAGES, LAW MODULATES: (I) BANK ACCOUNTS AND AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINE (ATM) PENETRATION FOR NEGATIVE INTERACTIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH MOBILE MONEY INNOVATIONS AND (II) BANK SECTOR CONCENTRATION FOR A POSITIVE INTERACTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH MOBILE MONEY ACCOUNTS. SECOND, FROM SUPPLY-SIDE LINKAGES, LAW INTERACTS WITH: (I) MOBILE SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MOBILE PHONE USED TO SEND MONEY; (II) MOBILE CONNECTIVITY COVERAGE FOR A NEGATIVE NEXUS ON THE MOBILE PHONE USED TO RECEIVE MONEY AND (III) MOBILE CONNECTIVITY PERFORMANCE FOR A NEGATIVE INFLUENCE ON THE MOBILE PHONE USED TO SEND/RECEIVE MONEY. POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE LIGHT OF ENHANCING THE RULE OF LAW AS WELL AS IMPROVING MOBILE PHONE SUBSCRIPTION, CONNECTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE DYNAMICS.
231	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE INFLUENCE OF NATIONAL CONTEXT ON CIVIL SOCIETY STRENGTH BASED ON FOUR KEY DIMENSIONS: LEVEL OF DEMOCRACY, POLITICAL STABILITY, RULE OF LAW AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. WHEREAS EXISTING STUDIES MAINLY FOCUS ON WESTERN AND POST-COMMUNIST COUNTRIES, WE EXPLICITLY INCLUDE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IN OUR ANALYSIS. WE USE ASSOCIATIONAL MEMBERSHIP AS PROXY FOR CIVIL SOCIETY STRENGTH AND INCLUDE DATA OF 53 COUNTRIES. RULE OF LAW, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND (TO A LESSER EXTENT) POLITICAL STABILITY EMERGE FROM OUR MULTILEVEL REGRESSION MODELS AS THE MAIN FACTORS AFFECTING CIVIL SOCIETY MEMBERSHIP. UNLIKE PREVIOUS STUDIES, WE SHOW THAT THESE RELATIONS ARE QUADRATIC INSTEAD OF LINEAR. THIS MEANS THAT WHERE EXISTING THEORIES PREDICT A DROP IN MEMBERSHIPS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WE FIND A RISE. IN OTHER WORDS, HARSH CONDITIONS ACTUALLY STRENGTHEN CIVIL SOCIETY IN TERMS OF MEMBERSHIP LEVELS. WE ARGUE THAT THIS COULD BE THE CASE BECAUSE REASONS FOR CSO MEMBERSHIP ARE ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT IN THE DEVELOPED AND IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD. CONTRARY TO THEORETICAL ASSUMPTIONS, DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS DO NOT APPEAR CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR CIVIL SOCIETY MEMBERSHIP.
232	OVER THE LAST DECADE, THE SUPREME COURT HAS GREATLY BROADENED THE IMMUNITY THAT STATES ENJOY FROM CITIZEN SUITS BROUGHT FOR VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL LAW. WITH ITS DECISIONS IN. SEMINOLE TRIBE V. FLORIDA AND ALDEN V. MAINE, THE COURT HAS ASSURED THAT STATES ARE NOW SUBSTANTIALLY IMMUNE FROM SUITS BROUGHT IN BOTH FEDERAL COURTS AND THE STATES' OWN COURTS. A STRONG IMMUNITY DOCTRINE IS NECESSARY, ACCORDING TO THE COURT, TO ASSURE THAT ESSENTIALLY POLITICAL DECISIONS REMAIN IN THE POLITICALLY ACCOUNTABLE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT RATHER THAN IN THE HANDS OF INDIVIDUAL LITIGANTS AND JUDGES. SCHOLARS, HOWEVER, HAVE CRITICIZED THIS JURISPRUDENCE AS ANTITHETICAL TO THE RULE OF LAW. THIS NOTE SEEKS TO RECONCILE THE COURT'S ACCOUNTABILITY CONCERNS WITH ITS CRITICS' RULE-OF-LAW CONCERNS. IT PROPOSES THAT CONGRESS ABROGATE STATE IMMUNITY FROM SUITS FOR VIOLATIONS OF PARTICULAR FEDERAL STATUTES IN LEGISLATIVE COURT'S-WHICH ARE POLITICAL BODIES IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. IN SUCH TRIBUNALS, INDIVIDUALS COULD VINDICATE THEIR FEDERAL STATUTORY RIGHTS, SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL AND OVERSIGHT OF POLITICALLY ACCOUNTABLE OFFICIALS IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.
233	JUDICIAL REFORM HAS BEEN PART AND PARCEL OF DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS AMONG COUNTRIES PREPARING FOR EUROPEAN UNION ACCESSION. THE LITERATURE ON EU ENLARGEMENT, POLITICAL CONDITIONALITY CONCEPTUALIZES THE EU'S ROLE IN PROMOTING RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL REFORMS IN ITS EXTERNAL NEIGHBOURHOOD, ESPECIALLY IN THE CANDIDATE STATES AS LARGELY POSITIVE. HOWEVER, IN THE TURKISH CASE, THE EU'S POLITICAL CONDITIONALITY IN JUDICIAL REFORM PRESENTS A MIXED PICTURE. THIS PAPER PROVIDES A QUALITATIVE CASE STUDY WITH THE AIM TO ASSESS THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH BACKSLIDING OCCURS. THE PAPER'S MAIN PROPOSITION IS THAT THIS BACKSLIDING IN JUDICIAL REFORMS AND RULE OF LAW IS DUE TO THE INTERPLAY OF THE RELATIVE WEAKNESS OF THE EU'S POLITICAL ANCHOR AND THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE DOMESTIC STRUGGLES FACING POLITICAL ELITES. JUDICIAL REFORMS EMERGE AS A VISIBLE ASPECT OF BACKSLIDING AS IT HAS BECOME A KEY PRIORITY AREA FOR THE EU. THIS PAPER ASSESSES TO WHAT EXTENT THE CHANGING PACE AND DIRECTION OF JUDICIAL REFORMS HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY A MIX OF FACTORS; THE EU'S POLITICAL CONDITIONALITY AS WELL AS THE DOMESTIC COSTS OF ADAPTATION.
234	DOES RELATED LENDING HAVE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF BANKING SYSTEMS? WE ANALYZE A UNIQUE CROSS-COUNTRY DATA SET COVERING 74 COUNTRIES FROM 1990 TO 2007, AND FIND THAT RELATED LENDING, ON AVERAGE, DOES NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE GROWTH OF CREDIT. WE DO FIND, HOWEVER, THAT THERE ARE CONDITIONAL RELATIONSHIPS: RELATED LENDING TENDS TO RETARD THE GROWTH OF BANKING SYSTEMS WHEN RULE OF LAW IS WEAK, WHEREAS IT TENDS TO PROMOTE THE GROWTH OF BANKING SYSTEMS WHEN RULE OF LAW IS STRONG. WE ALSO FIND THAT RELATED LENDING APPEARS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH LOOTING WHEN BANKS ARE OWNED BY NON-FINANCIAL FIRMS, BUT THAT IT DOES NOT DO SO WHEN NON-FINANCIAL FIRMS ARE OWNED BY BANKS. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT WHETHER RELATED LENDING IS POSITIVE OR PERNICIOUS DEPENDS CRITICALLY ON THE INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT IN WHICH IT TAKES PLACE; THERE IS NO SINGLE "BEST POLICY" REGARDING RELATED LENDING. THESE FINDINGS ARE ROBUST TO ALTERNATIVE SPECIFICATIONS, INCLUDING IV REGRESSIONS. JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES (2011) 42, 406-426. DOI: 10.1057/JIBS.2011.1
235	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE EFFECT OF THE ANTI-ENLIGHTENMENT TRADITION ON THE FUNCTIONING OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. THIS TRADITION COVERS A LACK OF BELIEF IN LIBERAL VALUES, HUMAN RIGHTS, EGALITARIANISM, THE RULE OF LAW, INDIVIDUALISM, TOLERANCE, AND THE RESPECTFUL COOPERATION AMONG PEOPLE. ITS IDEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND IS NOT NEW: ITS EXISTENCE IS ALSO THE REASON WHY SCHOLARS STARTED TO TALK ABOUT POST-FASCISM IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY. IN A NUMBER OF EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES, WHERE AUTOCRATIC TENDENCIES HAVE RECENTLY BEEN WITNESSED (LIKE IN HUNGARY OR POLAND), IT STARTED TO DOMINATE DECISION-MAKING, WHILE ITS PRESENCE IS ALSO VISIBLE ELSEWHERE, LIKE IN THE UK, GERMANY, AND ITALY. THIS ARTICLE SELECTS FOUR PRIME EXAMPLES (THE RULE OF LAW BACKLASH, REFUGEE LAW, BREXIT, AND CHANGES TO THE SINGLE MARKET) TO SHOW HOW ARGUMENTS CONTAINING ELEMENTS OF THE ANTI-ENLIGHTENMENT TRADITION ARE USED IN A CYNICAL WAY TO SUPPORT PARTISAN AND OPPRESSIVE POLITICS WHILE MAINTAINING A SEEMINGLY INCLUSIVE FACADE OF DEMOCRATIC DECISION-MAKING. IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, THIS CAN RESULT IN DUBIOUS, UN-EXPLAINED MEASURES AND GREAT POLICY CHANGES BOTH AT EU AND MEMBER STATE LEVEL.
236	JOURNALISTS HAVE THE POWER TO ENHANCE THE VISIBILITY OF CERTAIN ASPECTS OF CAMPAIGN ISSUES AND, THUS, ARE RELEVANT MEDIATORS BETWEEN POLITICAL ACTORS AND CITIZENS. TO SERVE THE PUBLIC INTEREST, NEWS MEDIA COVERAGE SHOULD INCLUDE THE VIEWS OF DIFFERENT POLITICAL CAMPS AND SHOULD ENABLE CITIZENS TO BUILD OPINIONS IN AN ENLIGHTENED WAY. THE AUTHORS ANALYZE JOURNALISTS' FRAMING OF THE COVERAGE OF A 2008 CAMPAIGN ON THE NATURALIZATION OF IMMIGRANTS. CONTENT ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED OF ALL CAMPAIGN COVERAGE BY TV STATIONS AND MAJOR NEWSPAPER OUTLETS OVER A PERIOD OF 14 WEEKS. TO IDENTIFY DOMINANT FRAMES, THE AUTHORS CODED ALL CAMPAIGN ARGUMENTS MADE IN NEWS MEDIA COVERAGE (N = 3,570). THE RESULTS SHOW THAT MEDIA COVERAGE FOCUSED ON THREE SUBSTANTIVE FRAMES-RULE OF LAW, MASS NATURALIZATION, AND PEOPLE'S FINAL SAY. THE FINDINGS REVEAL THAT COVERAGE WAS NOT BALANCED BUT WAS CLEARLY IN FAVOR OF THE RULE OF LAW FRAME. THIS FRAMING BIAS APPLIES TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEDIA, INCLUDING PUBLIC SERVICE TV AND ELITE NEWSPAPERS. FURTHERMORE, THE AUTHORS FOUND A STRIKING BIAS TOWARD INSTITUTIONAL ACTORS, WHO WERE COVERED MUCH MORE OFTEN THAN CIVIL SOCIETY ACTORS.
237	MODERN SOCIETY IS BASED ON THE PREDOMINANCE OF ORGANIC SOLIDARITY OVER MECHANICAL SOLIDARITY AND, CONSEQUENTLY, ON THE PREDOMINANCE OF THE LAW, WHICH ENSURES COOPERATION BETWEEN AUTONOMOUS SUBJECTS FROM REPRESSIVE LAW, WHICH SANCTIONS, THROUGH PENALTY, ANY DEVIATION FROM THE STANDARDS OF THE COMMON CONSCIENCE. MODERN SOCIETY IS "CIVILIZED", I.E. IT IS FIRSTLY AND FOREMOST BASED ON "CIVIL" LAW, THE REPRESSIVE LAW ONLY BEING EXCEPTIONAL, WHICH TRANSLATES INTO THREE PRINCIPLES: THAT OF THE SUBSIDIARITY OF CRIMINAL LAW, THAT OF THE NECESSITY AND LEGALITY OF OFFENCES AND PENALTIES, AND THAT OF THE ADDITIONAL PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM WHEN THE SUBJECT IS CRIMINALLY CHARGED. THE CONSEQUENCE THEREOF IS THAT, IN MODERN LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES, ALL REPRESSIVE LAW IS CRIMINAL, THAT ANY CHARGE WHICH MAY LEAD TO THE APPLICATION OF A REPRESSIVE SANCTION IS A CRIMINAL CHARGE AND THAT THE LAW-MAKER CANNOT ASSIGN TO THE ADMINISTRATION THE COMPETENCE REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF REPRESSIVE SANCTIONS. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE TRANSFORMATION OF SOME REPRESSIVE NORMS INTO NORMS OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IS A VIOLATION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES THAT STRUCTURE THE LEGAL ORDER OF MODERN LIBERAL STATES. NONETHELESS, THIS TYPE OF PRACTICE IS BECOMING MORE COMMON. IN ORDER TO ENSURE INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM, THIS TENDENCY MUST BE CORRECTED. AS POLITICIANS ARE NOT WILLING TO DO SO, NATURALLY THIS IS A TASK FOR THE JUDICIAL COURTS, THAT CAN RELY FOR THIS ENDEAVOUR ON THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS' CONSTRUCTIVE JURISPRUDENCE.
238	THE STUDY COVERS THREE COMPONENTS OF THE FACILITY FOR PROTECTING PUBLIC UTILITIES MARKET PARTICIPANTS IN THE PUBLIC UTILITIES MARKET: PREVENTION OF POTENTIAL POVERTY, REDUCTION OF EXISTING POVERTY AND COMPENSATION TO THE INJURED PARTY IN A CASE OF TORT THAT EXACERBATES OR THREATENS TO EXACERBATE ITS POVERTY. THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON OFFICIAL STATISTICAL INFORMATION ON THE ACTIVITIES OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES SECTOR. OPERATIONAL INFORMATION OF PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICE PROVIDERS REGARDING CERTAIN INDICATORS OF THEIR ACTIVITY IN THE WORK WAS NOT STUDIED. THIS APPROACH NARROWS THE EMPIRICAL BASIS OF THE STUDY, BUT AT THE PRESENT STAGE IN THE CONTEXT OF DIFFERENT RATES OF IMPLEMENTATION OF CHANGES IN REGIONS, SECTORS AND AT THE LEVEL OF INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES, AS WELL AS LACK OF UNIFORMITY IN THE STRUCTURE OF INDICATORS PUBLISHED BY SERVICE PROVIDERS, ANALYSIS ALLOWS TO IDENTIFY "BOTTLENECKS" OF LEGAL REGULATION, WHICH ARE SYSTEMIC IN NATURE AND LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE SUBJECTIVE FACTOR.
239	TWO PHILOSOPHERS AND PROMINENT PUBLIC FIGURES EXPLORE THE SPIRITUAL AND CULTURAL FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH RUSSIA'S CRISIS AND PROSPECTS FOR SOCIAL RENEWAL MUST BE UNDERSTOOD. THEIR DISCUSSION RANGES OVER SEVERAL MAIN AREAS OF CONCERN IN RUSSIA TODAY: THE NATURE OF THE PERSON AND HER CAPACITIES AS SOCIAL ACTOR, THE FORMS OF SOCIALITY RUSSIA HAS KNOWN AS SEEN AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF ORTHODOXY AND COMMUNISM, AND RUSSIA'S TRAGEDY DURING THE SEVENTY-FIVE YEARS OF COMMUNISM. A 'THIRD PATH' IS ENVISAGED FOR RUSSIAN RENEWAL BASED ON GEOPOLITICAL, CULTURAL, AND SPIRITUAL CONSTANTS IN THE HISTORY OF THE NATION.
240	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INWARD FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT INFLOWS AND GOVERNANCE OF THE UNITED STATES, CHINA, AND SINGAPORE. THE STUDY EMPLOYS GOVERNANCE INDICATORS INCLUDING CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND THE ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, RULE OF LAW, VOICE, AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INWARD FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT FLOWS AND GOVERNANCE FOR THE PERIOD 2002-2019. THE BASELINE REGRESSION RESULTS ARE BASED ON BIVARIATE AND MULTIVARIATE REGRESSIONS WITH FIXED EFFECTS. THE RESULTS CONFIRM A DIRECT AND SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNANCE AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT. THE RESULTS ARE ROBUST WHILE APPLYING OTHER REGRESSION TECHNIQUES SUCH AS PRAIS-WINSTEN REGRESSION, DRISCOLL-KRAAY REGRESSION, AND A TWO-STEP SYSTEM GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS' ESTIMATION. MORE SPECIFICALLY, ALL SIX GOVERNANCE INDICATORS INCLUDING CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND THE ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, RULE OF LAW, VOICE, AND ACCOUNTABILITY EXHIBIT THE SAME I.E., DIRECT AND SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. THE PAPER ALSO SUGGESTS VARIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INVESTORS AT THE INDIVIDUAL AND COUNTRY LEVELS.
241	SCHEUERMAN'S BOOK IS ONE OF THE HANDFUL OF SIGNIFICANT ATTEMPTS TO RETHINK SCHMITT'S WORK SYSTEMATICALLY OVER THE PAST FOUR DECADES. IN SO DOING, HE RAISES THREE KEY QUESTIONS FOR ME. FIRST, IS SCHMITT'S WORK A SINCERE CONTRIBUTION TO LEGAL AND POLITICAL THEORY, OR AN ATTEMPT TO ARGUE FOR SETTING THE RULE OF LAW ASIDE FOR AUTHORITARIANISM, THAT IS, AN INSTRUMENTAL CRITIQUE OF INDETERMINACY? SECOND, TO WHAT EXTENT IS SCHMITT - CRITICAL OF THE 'BOURGEOIS' RULE OF LAW, CRITICAL OF GLOBALIZATION - REALLY A THINKER DEFENDING CAPITALISM? CAN HE REALLY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ORDOLIBERALS (EVEN IF THEY ADOPTED HIS ARGUMENTS FROM 1931 TO 1932 IN THEIR OWN WRITING OF THE TIME)? THIRD, TO WHAT EXTENT WERE SCHMITT'S EARLY CONTRIBUTIONS TO NATIONAL SOCIALIST LAW AIMED AT RESPONDING TO LEGAL INDETERMINACY, AND TO WHAT EXTENT DID THEY IN FACT POINT TOWARDS A RADICALISM OF GERMAN LAW WITHIN THE NAZI SYSTEM, ESPECIALLY INSOFAR AS THEY ENDORSED MAKING DECISIONS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE OF THE NAZI STATE - AND POTENTIALLY AGAINST THE EXPRESS LANGUAGE OF STATUTES?
242	THIS ARTICLE USES THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS DECISION IN ANHEUSER-BUSCH V PORTUGAL (2007) TO EXPLORE THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-SPECIFICALLY TRADEMARKS-AND HUMAN RIGHTS. IT APPLIES THE THREE POSSIBLE PARADIGMS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-HUMAN RIGHTS JURISPRUDENCE IDENTIFIED BY LAURENCE HELFER-"RULE OF LAW'', "ENFORCEMENT'' AND "BALANCING''-TO ANHEUSER-BUSCH AND THEN CRITIQUES THE COURT'S LACK OF ENGAGEMENT WITH THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ELEMENTS OF THE CASE, PARTICULARLY THE THEORETICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF TRADEMARK LAW AS DISTINCTLY COMMERCIAL PROPERTY. IT CONCLUDES THAT THIS MAKES TRADEMARKS ESPECIALLY UNSUITABLE FOR TREATMENT IN A HUMAN RIGHTS CONTEXT. AGREEING WITH HELFER'S PRESCRIPTION FOR THE "RULE OF LAW'' PARADIGM WHEN TAKING SUCH CASES IN THE FUTURE, THIS ARTICLE EMPHASIZES THAT AN ADDITIONAL SENSITIVITY TO THE SPECIAL NATURE OF THE SUBJECT MATTER MUST BE INVOLVED IF THE COURT WERE TO TAKE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CASES IN THE FUTURE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THAT COURT'S OVERSIGHT MAY ENABLE THE PROLIFERATION OF THE CONCEPT OF "CORPORATE HUMAN RIGHTS''-POTENTIALLY LEADING TO CORROSIVE EFFECTS ON THE INTEGRITY OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS LAW IT SEEKS TO PROTECT.
243	IN CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY OF LAW THE COMPLEX PROBLEM OF THE RELATION AMONG FEELING, THE WILL, AND THE RULE OF LAW HAS AGAIN GAINED PROMINENCE, AFFECTING IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS THE SHIFTING BALANCE BETWEEN POLIS AND OIKOS, BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE SPHERE (THIS IS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE RECENT STUDIES BY MARTHA NUSSBAUM, AMONG OTHERS). BEFORE THE PROBLEM CAN BE ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED, A CORRECT ANTHROPOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK MUST BE ESTABLISHED FOR THE WILL: HERE, THIS MEANS RECOVERING THE CLASSICAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN VOLUNTAS UT NATURA AND VOLUNTAS UT RATIO. AS IS KNOWN, THE FIRST PERSPECTIVE PLACES THE WILL AT THE LEVEL OF THE INSTINCTS AND EMOTIONS, AND CAN HARDLY PROVIDE A PROPER FOUNDATION FOR THE RULE OF LAW (FOR ITS PRETENSIONS TO JUSTICE AND UNIVERSALITY ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SUBJECTIVITY OF FEELINGS); THE SECOND ALLOWS FOR THE RATIONAL PROCESSING OF APPETITES AND SUBJECTIVE CLAIMS, PUTTING THEM TO THE TEST OF NATURAL LAW, OR, FROM A KANTIAN PERSPECTIVE, THE TEST OF UNIVERSALIZATION. THIS FRAMEWORK HELPS US TO CRITICIZE THE NEW LIBERTARIAN PARADIGM OF NATURAL LAW, FAR REMOVED FROM THE CLASSICAL PARADIGM.
244	THE WORK IS DEVOTED TO IDENTIFYING THE MAIN PROBLEMS IN THE FIELD OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE RESEARCH APPLIES THE FORMAL-LEGAL, HISTORICAL AND LEGAL, COMPARATIVE AND MODELING METHODOLOGY. THE ORDER AND ISSUES TO BE CONSIDERED ARE AS FOLLOWS: IN THE FIRST SECTION, WE WILL CONSIDER THE CHALLENGES AND THREATS TO JUSTICE THAT EMERGED DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. IN THE SECOND SECTION, WE WILL SEE THE JUDICIAL EXPERIENCE DURING THE PANDEMIC IN THE CONTEXT OF THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE JUDICIARY. IN THE THIRD SECTION, WE EXAMINE THE APPLICATION OF ORGANIZATIONAL AND PROCEDURAL PRINCIPLES OF THE JUDICIARY DURING THE PANDEMIC CRISIS. IN THE FINAL FOURTH SECTION, WE WILL ASSESS THE ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNMENT BODIES IN OPTIMIZING THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. AS A RESULT OF THE WORK, EMPHASIZING THE VULNERABILITY OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND JUSTICE STANDARDS, THE AUTHORS SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF EXCHANGE OF EXPERIENCE AND COOPERATION NOT ONLY AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT ALSO AT THE LEVEL OF PROFESSIONAL COMMUNITIES OF JUDGES, IN PARTICULAR WITH THE MEMBERS AND JUDGES OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF JUSTICE, THE ADVISORY COUNCIL OF EUROPEAN JUDGES, AND THE EUROPEAN HUMAN RIGHTS COURTS.
245	IMF LOANS REACT TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS BUT ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO POLITICAL-ECONOMY VARIABLES. LOANS TEND TO BE LARGER AND MORE FREQUENT WHEN A COUNTRY HAS A BIGGER QUOTA AND MORE PROFESSIONAL STAFF AT THE IMF AND WHEN A COUNTRY IS MORE CONNECTED POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY TO THE UNITED STATES AND MAJOR EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THESE RESULTS ARE OF CONSIDERABLE INTEREST FOR THEIR OWN SAKE. MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR PRESENT PURPOSES, THE RESULTS PROVIDE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES FOR ESTIMATING THE EFFECTS OF IMF LOAN PROGRAMS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH AND OTHER VARIABLES. THIS INSTRUMENTAL ESTIMATION ALLOWS US TO SORT OUT THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THE LOAN PROGRAMS FROM THE RESPONSES OF IMF LENDING TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THE ESTIMATES SHOW THAT A HIGHER IMF LOAN-PARTICIPATION RATE REDUCES ECONOMIC GROWTH. IMF LENDING DOES NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON INVESTMENT, INFLATION, GOVERNMENT CONSUMPTION, AND INTERNATIONAL OPENNESS. HOWEVER, IMF LOAN PARTICIPATION HAS SMALL NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE REDUCTION IN THE RULE OF LAW IMPLIES AN ADDITIONAL, INDIRECT CHANNEL WHEREBY IMF LENDING REDUCES ECONOMIC GROWTH. (C) 2005 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
246	ONE OF THE BROADEST INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES IN RECENT YEARS IS THE PERFECT CASE TO TEST JUDGE YUSUF'S ASSERTION THAT "THERE CAN BE NO RULE OF LAW WITHOUT A COURT TO APPLY IT." FROM 2017 TO 2021, BAHRAIN, EGYPT, SAUDI ARABIA, AND THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (THE "QUARTET"), ON ONE HAND, AND QATAR, ON THE OTHER, WERE ENGAGED IN A STANDOFF, SEVERING NEARLY ALL DIPLOMATIC AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS AND LODGING A NUMBER OF LEGAL CHALLENGES IN VARIOUS FORA. THESE PROCEEDINGS COLLECTIVELY TOUCHED ON TREATY INTERPRETATION, STATE RESPONSIBILITY, COUNTERMEASURES AND NON-COERCIVE SANCTIONS, HUMAN RIGHTS, INVESTMENT AND TRADE, AVIATION LAW, AND STILL OTHER LEGAL ISSUES. BY COMPARING THE JURISDICTION, REASONING, AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE DIFFERENT MODALITIES OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION, THIS ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THAT INTERNATIONAL COURTS WERE NEITHER SUFFICIENT NOR NECESSARY FOR RESOLVING THE MACRO DISPUTE AMONG THE PARTIES, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF NON-JUDICIAL ALTERNATIVE PROCEEDINGS. IT ILLUSTRATES, WITH RESPECT TO JUDGE YUSUF, THAT NONJUDICIAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION FORA ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS INTERNATIONAL COURTS FOR UPHOLDING THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW.
247	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE EFFECTS OF GOVERNANCE ON ARMED CONFLICT AND THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN ECONOMIC FACTORS, EXTERNAL FINANCES (REMITTANCES), NATURAL CALAMITIES, AND ARMED CONFLICTS. PANEL DATA ARE USED COVERING THE SOUTH ASIA REGION FROM 2002 TO 2018, APPLYING THE LOGIT AND ARDL MODELS. BASED ON THE LOGIT ANALYSIS, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE/TERRORISM, AND REGULATORY QUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND DROUGHTS/FLOODS HAVE A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH ARMED CONFLICT. ON THE OTHER HAND, POPULATION, REMITTANCES, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY HAVE POSITIVE ASSOCIATION WITH ARMED CONFLICT. BASED ON ARDL ESTIMATIONS, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, A PROXY VARIABLE FOR GOVERNANCE, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE/TERRORISM, AND THE RULE OF LAW HAVE NEGATIVE AND HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION WITH ARMED CONFLICT. IT IS IMPLIED THAT GOOD GOVERNANCE CAN REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF ARMED CONFLICT, WHILE POPULATION AND REMITTANCES CAN FUEL ARMED CONFLICT. MOREOVER, NATURAL CALAMITIES HAVE AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP WITH ARMED CONFLICT. SURPRISINGLY, CONFLICTS HELP INCREASE THE VOICE OF AND DEMAND FOR ACCOUNTABILITY BY GENERAL PUBLIC IN THE CONFLICT ZONE.
248	NORTH ET AL. (2009) ARGUE THAT ACCOUNTING FOR DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES REQUIRES UNDERSTANDING HOW DIFFERENT SOCIETIES MANAGE VIOLENCE. ALMOST ALL SOCIETIES HAVE BEEN LIMITED-ACCESS ORDERS WHERE ELITES CONSTRAIN VIOLENCE TO PRESERVE THEIR RENTS. ALTERNATIVELY, IN OPEN-ACCESS ORDERS, VIOLENCE IS CONSTRAINED BY A GOVERNMENT CHARACTERIZED BY WIDESPREAD POLITICAL PARTICIPATION. OPEN-ACCESS SOCIETIES WERE THE FIRST CASES OF SUSTAINED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT; ALMOST ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN WESTERN EUROPEAN OR OFFSHOOTS. UNDERSTANDING WHY IS IMPORTANT. NORTH ET AL. ELABORATE ON THREE NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR ACHIEVING OPEN ACCESS: (1) RULE OF LAW FOR ELITES, (2) SUPPORT FOR PERPETUALLY-LIVED ORGANIZATIONS, AND (3) CENTRALIZATION AND CONSOLIDATION OF VIOLENCE. THESE CONSTITUTE THE "DOORSTEP" TO AN OPEN-ACCESS ORDER. I ARGUE THAT SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARDS THIS DOORSTEP WAS AFFECTED BY THE CAROLINGIANS OF THE EARLY MEDIEVAL ERA. I EMPHASIZE THEIR LARGE-SCALE DISTRIBUTIONS OF CONFISCATED/CONQUERED LANDS TO VASSALS, CULTIVATION OF BONDS WITH THE CHURCH, AND REGULARIZATION OF ASSEMBLIES. THE CAROLINGIANS INTRODUCED GOVERNANCE INNOVATIONS THAT IMPERSONALIZED RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ELITES AND ENCOURAGED THEIR ENFORCEMENT UNDER THE RULE OF LAW.
249	ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE IS A CLASSIC ISSUE OF CONCERN IN REGULATION LITERATURE. DESPITE A VAST LITERATURE ON REGULATORY AGENCIES, COMPLIANCE BEHAVIOR OF THE REGULATED PARTIES, ESPECIALLY BUSINESS FIRMS, IS MUCH LESS UNDERSTOOD. THE EXISTING COMPLIANCE LITERATURE DRAWS ON EVIDENCE FROM WESTERN SOCIETIES AND HAS PREDOMINANTLY FOCUSED ON COMPLIANCE IN RULE OF LAW SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, IN CHINA WHERE THE RULE OF LAW REMAINS WEAK, MANY REGULATIONS TAKE THE FORM OF ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIVE DOCUMENTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE ORDERS, SOME OF WHICH ARE EXTRA-LEGAL YET WIDELY USED AS THE BASIS FOR ENFORCING POLICIES. THEREFORE, IT IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO EXTEND THE SCOPE OF COMPLIANCE RESEARCH TO THE BROADER DOMAIN OF GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS. THE "PERVASIVE THREAT" MODEL OF COMPLIANCE REPRESENTS A POTENTIALLY PROMISING ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE HOW BUSINESSES FACTOR REGULATORY OFFICIALS' DISCRETION INTO COMPLIANCE DECISION-MAKING. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN "PERVASIVE THREAT" AND OTHER EXPLANATIONS FOR COMPLIANCE, THE SENSITIVITY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF FIRMS TO PERVASIVE THREAT, AS WELL AS THE APPLICABILITY OF THIS MODEL ACROSS POLICY AREAS.
250	PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYZE THE DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS THAT INSTITUTIONS HAVE ON COUNTRY IPO ACTIVITY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH WITH A SAMPLE OF 64 COUNTRIES OVER A 15-YEAR PERIOD (2000-2014), THE AUTHORS TEST THE VARIABLES RULE OF LAW, UNCERTAINTY AVOIDANCE AND MASCULINITY ON SUBSAMPLES OF DEVELOPED (27) AND EMERGING (37) COUNTRIES TO EXPLORE THEIR INFLUENCE ON DOMESTIC IPO ACTIVITY LEVEL. FINDINGS FOR DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, ONLY UNCERTAINTY AVOIDANCE AND MASCULINITY ARE SIGNIFICANT. WITHIN EMERGING COUNTRIES, IT IS UNCERTAINTY AVOIDANCE AND RULE OF LAW THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - USING DIFFERENT COUNTRY CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORKS COULD YIELD MORE DETAILED AND FOCUSED RESULTS ON THE INFLUENCE THAT COUNTRY-LEVEL VARIABLES HAVE ON IPO ACTIVITY. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - MULTINATIONAL FIRMS COULD USE THESE FINDINGS FOR DECISIONS RELATED TO THEIR POTENTIAL SUBSIDIARY IPOS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS IS A NOVEL EMPIRICAL WORK RELATING INSTITUTIONS TO IPO ACTIVITY, USING EMERGING AND DEVELOPED COUNTRY SUBSAMPLES. IT ALSO FOCUSES ON IPO ACTIVITY INSTEAD OF IPO UNDERPRICING/PERFORMANCE AND CONTRIBUTES TO EXTEND THE SCOPE OF THE IPO LITERATURE TO GLOBAL NON-ANGLO CONTEXTS.
251	THE MODERN STATE AROSE IN WESTERN EUROPE AND WAS TRANSPLANTED TO EUROPEAN SETTLER COLONIES. THE QUESTION ABOUT WHY WESTERN EUROPE DEVELOPED HIGH-CAPACITY STATES BOUND BY THE RULE OF LAW REMAINS A CORE CONCERN OF MODERN SOCIAL SCIENCE. PRIOR SCHOLARSHIP DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE HAS GENERALLY FAVORED DIFFERENT VARIANTS OF A WAR-AND-STATE-MAKING PERSPECTIVE. HOWEVER, GENERALIZED GEOPOLITICAL PRESSURE DOES LITTLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE MODERN STATE AROSE IN EUROPE AND NOT IN OTHER HISTORICAL MULTISTATE SYSTEMS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE EUROPEAN OUTCOME WAS CONDITIONAL ON THE PRIOR EXISTENCE OF "MEDIEVAL COMMUNALISM," THAT IS, ON STRONG NORMS AND INSTITUTIONS OF COMMUNAL REPRESENTATION, BASED ON UNITS SUCH AS PARISHES AND TOWNS. IT WAS DUE TO THESE INITIAL CONDITIONS THAT GEOPOLITICAL PRESSURE FACILITATED NOT ONLY A STRENGTHENING OF STATE CAPACITY BUT ALSO THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHECKS ON STATE POWER IN THE FORM OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARGUMENT IS FIRST THEORIZED AND THEN ILLUSTRATED EMPIRICALLY USING A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES FROM BOTH WITHIN AND BEYOND EUROPE. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRESENT-DAY STATE BUILDING ARE BRIEFLY DISCUSSED.
252	THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE. THE PUBLIC GOVERNANCE IN THIS STUDY REFERS TO INDICATORS NAMELY PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, REGULATORY QUALITY AND POLITICAL STABILITY AND RULE OF LAW. MEANWHILE, ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY REFERS TO COUNTRY'S ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE. THE STUDY WAS DRIVEN BY PHENOMENA THAT COUNTRIES LOCATED IN THE SAME CATEGORIZATION OF GEOGRAPHIC BUT HAVE DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE. THE STUDY INVOLVED 178 COUNTRIES MEMBER OF WORLD BANK. PURPOSIVE SAMPLING TECHNIQUE WAS USED IN THIS STUDY. PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY WERE TREATED AS TWO INDEPENDENT VARIABLES. THE DEGREE OF CORRELATION BETWEEN VARIABLES WAS ANALYZED USING BIVARIATE CORRELATION ANALYSIS. WORLD GOVERNANCE INDEX (WGI) WAS ADOPTED AS AN APPROACH TO PUBLIC GOVERNANCE MEASUREMENT. ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY WAS MEASURED USING ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE INDEX (EPI). THE FINDINGS SHOWED THAT PUBLIC GOVERNANCE INDICATORS NAMELY, PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND POLITICAL STABILITY HAVE A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION WITH ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE.
253	THIRTY-FIVE MUSLIM-MAJORITY AND 18 MUSLIM-MINORITY COUNTRIES FORMALLY INTEGRATE MUSLIM FAMILY LAWS (MFLS) INTO THEIR LEGAL SYSTEMS AND ENFORCE THEM THROUGH STATE COURTS. BOTH MUSLIM-MAJORITY AND MUSLIM-MINORITY GOVERNMENTS HAVE UNDERTAKEN LEGISLATIVE REFORMS TO ALLEVIATE THE EFFECTS OF RELIGIOUS LAWS ON FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS, INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY, AND STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN THEIR MFL SYSTEMS. EXTANT LITERATURE IS SILENT ON WHETHER MFLS ARE MORE REFORMED OR MORE HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW COMPLIANT IN MUSLIM-MAJORITY OR MUSLIM-MINORITY COUNTRIES. UTILIZING A NOVEL METHODOLOGICAL TOOL, THE MFL INDEX, THIS EXPLORATORY ARTICLE SURVEYS CROSS-NATIONAL AND HISTORICAL TRENDS IN MFL REFORM (1946-2016). IT SHOWS THAT MUSLIM-MAJORITY AND -MINORITY GOVERNMENTS HAVE OPTED FOR DIFFERENT FORMS OF LEGISLATIVE REFORM. MUSLIM-MAJORITY COUNTRIES FAVORED SUBSTANTIVE REFORM, WHILE MUSLIM-MINORITY STATES PRIORITIZED EXIT REFORMS. THE TYPE AND EXTENT OF REFORM WERE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH COLONIAL HERITAGE, SECULARISM, WOMEN'S ACTIVISM, ETHNORELIGIOUS DIVERSITY, AND PREVAILING MULTICULTURAL ARRANGEMENTS. THESE FINDINGS HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR STUDYING MULTICULTURAL THEORY, HUMAN/WOMEN'S RIGHTS, AND DEMOCRATIZATION IN THE MUSLIM WORLD AND BEYOND.
254	THIS PAPER ANALYSES HOW RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE JURISDICTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATION MAY HAVE INFLUENCED THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION. ARISING INITIALLY TO DEFINE THE JURISDICTION OF THAT LITIGATION IN THE CIVIL COURTS, THE SUBSEQUENT EVOLUTION OF THE CATEGORY HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY THE SEARCH FOR A MATERIAL CRITERION THAT COULD PROVIDE IT WITH A PARTICULAR MEANING AND SET IT APART FROM THE JUDICIARY. THE CONSTITUTION OF SPAIN, IN AT LEAST TWO ASPECTS, HAS BEEN THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THIS JURISDICTIONAL CHANGE: ON THE ONE HAND, TO RECOGNIZE THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION AND, ON THE OTHER, THE STATEMENT THAT SUCH PROTECTION CAN BE PRESENTED IN TERMS OF THE "ADMINISTRATIVE RULINGS". THE ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION TAKES ON SECONDARY ROLE, DISPLACED BY THE DEMAND FOR EFFECTIVE PROTECTION WITH RESPECT TO ANY FORM OF ACTION ON THE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION. THE JURISPRUDENCE IN THIS PAPER, INCLUDING SOME OF THE MOST NOTABLE OUTSTANDING EXAMPLES, DEMONSTRATES THIS APOPHASIS. IN FACT, WE ARE EXPERIENCING A CHANGE WICH IS PRECURSOR OF A MORE PROFOUND CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW.
255	THE RELEVANCE OF THE PROBLEM UNDER STUDY IS DUE TO THE NEED TO MONITORING THE GENERAL SITUATION TO RESPECT TO HUMAN RIGHTS. THE ESTABLISHMENT, PROVISION AND REALIZATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR IN A STATE, WHICH INDICATES ITS DEMOCRACY, SOCIALITY, AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT SUCH A STATE IS LEGAL. PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IN THE STUDY THE ISSUES OF LEGAL PROTECTION OF VULNERABLE CATEGORIES OF POPULATION IN THE CONTEXT OF FORMATION OF ACTIVE HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY OF STATE AIMED AT INCREASING THE CAPACITY OF SOCIALLY VULNERABLE GROUPS AND REDUCING THE RISKS OF GROWING SOCIAL TENSIONS IN SOCIETY. THE LEADING METHOD FOR STUDYING THIS PROBLEM IS THE LEGAL SOCIOLOGICAL METHOD, WHICH ALLOWS US TO STUDY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF STATE AND LEGAL REGULATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS OF THE EUROPEAN EXPERIENCE IN COMBATING INTOLERANCE AND DISCRIMINATION. ITS TYPES MAIN DETERMINED HAVE BEEN. HIGHLIGHTED THE CRITERIA BY WHICH DISCRIMINATION IS PROHIBITED. THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION MECHANISMS IS ANALYZED. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS SCIENTIFIC CATEGORIES: DISCRIMINATION, HATE CRIMES, VULNERABLE GROUPS. THE PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE LIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROPOSALS FOR IMPROVING DOMESTIC LEGISLATION.
256	THE AUTHOR EXAMINES THE ROLE OF RUSSIA'S WTO ACCESSION IN SHAPING INSTITUTIONAL ADAPTATION ACROSS SEVERAL IMPORTANT DIMENSIONS, ARGUING THAT WTO ACCESSION HAS GENERATED MORE SCOPE FOR PRO-TRADE AS OPPOSED TO PROTECTIONIST DOMESTIC INTEREST GROUPS, CONSTRAINED THE SCOPE OF TRADE POLICY, AND MADE MORE AND BETTER INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO DELIBERATIONS BY BUSINESS AND THE PUBLIC RELATED TO TRADE. ADJUSTMENTS TO RUSSIAN LEGISLATION AND TRADE POLICIES THROUGH THE LENGTHY ACCESSION PROCESS HAVE, IT IS ARGUED, HELPED ELICIT MORE TRANSPARENT FORMS OF BUSINESS-GOVERNMENT COORDINATION. THE ARTICLE ALSO EXPLORES THE ROLE OF RUSSIA'S WTO COMMITMENTS IN SHAPING THE FUNCTIONING OF THE EURASIAN CUSTOMS UNION FORMED IN 2010. THE CRISIS IN RUSSIA'S RELATIONS WITH THE EU AND THE US, INITIALLY SPARKED BY CONTENDING PROJECTS OF REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION, WILL BE A MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR THE WTO'S AGENDA-SETTING AND CONFLICT MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS, A TEST HAVING IMPLICATIONS FOR THE BROAD QUESTION OF RELEVANCE OF THE WTO IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF RENEWED GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS AMONG MAJOR POWERS.
257	FRIEDRICH A. HAYEK THOROUGHLY CRITICIZES LABOR UNIONS IN SECT. 18 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF LIBERTY PUBLISHED IN 1960 AND INSISTS IN THE SAME SECTION THAT CLOSED-SHOP CONTRACTS SHOULD BE ILLEGAL. HE ALSO VIEWS YELLOW-DOG CONTRACTS, WHICH WERE DESIGNED AS COUNTERMEASURES AGAINST THE LABOR UNIONS, AS ILLEGAL. HOWEVER, IT HAS BEEN POINTED OUT THAT, ACCORDING TO HAYEK'S SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY, NEITHER THE CLOSED-SHOP CONTRACT NOR THE YELLOW-DOG CONTRACT SHOULD BE SEEN AS LEGAL ISSUES, AS THEY ARE BASED ON FREE WILL BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND HAVE NO COMPULSORY ELEMENTS. THE KEY TO SOLVING THIS DILEMMA IS IN UNDERSTANDING HOW HAYEK VIEWS THE CORE CONCEPTS OF THE U.S. ANTITRUST LAW, NAMELY, RESTRAINT OF TRADE AND MONOPOLY. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO EXAMINE THE THEORETICAL STRUCTURE OF HAYEK'S ARGUMENTS ON THOSE TYPES OF CONTRACTS, FREEDOM AND COERCION, THE 'RESTRAINT OF TRADE' DOCTRINE, AND THE RULE OF LAW. IT ADDRESSES THE IMPORTANT COMMON LAW ISSUES OF FREEDOM, COERCION, MONOPOLY, RESTRAINT OF TRADE, AND THE RULE OF LAW.
258	ALTHOUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY HAS NOT CHANGED THE BASIC PRINCIPLES AND THEORIES OF ECONOMIC LAW, IT HAS IMPACTED ITS RELATED SPECIFIC THEORIES. THUS, IT IS PARTICULARLY NECESSARY TO FURTHER DEVELOP ITS SPACE THEORY, ENTITY THEORY AND BEHAVIOR THEORY, SINCE SPACE, ENTITY AND BEHAVIOR ARE THE THREE KEY FACTORS AFFECTING ITS APPLICATION SCOPE. FURTHERMORE, "SPACE DIVERSIFICATION," "ENTITY ONLINE PLATFORM" AND "BEHAVIOR INFORMATIZATION" BASED ON THE DIGITAL ECONOMY, HAVE CREATED NEW REGULATORY ISSUES AND NEED THE ABOVE SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENTS, BASED ON WHICH THE MODULATION THEORY, INFORMATION THEORY, RISK THEORY AND RULE OF LAW THEORY OF ECONOMIC LAW CAN THEN ALSO BE FURTHER DEVELOPED. THUS, ALL THESE DEVELOPMENTS COMBINED ARE CONDUCIVE TO ADVANCING THE ECONOMIC-LAW'S OPERATION THEORY, NORM THEORY, AS WELL AS THE ONTOLOGICAL AND AXIOLOGICAL RESEARCH. IN ADDITION, SUCH DEVELOPMENTS ARE CONDUCIVE TO STRENGTHENING THE CONVINCING POWER AND GUIDING POWER OF ECONOMIC LAW THEORIES FOR THE RULE OF LAW CONSTRUCTION RELATED TO THE DIGITAL ECONOMY, TO PROMOTING A NEW DEVELOPMENT LANDSCAPE AND A MODERN ECONOMIC SYSTEM, AND TO REALIZING CHINESE MODERNIZATION.
259	ENGAGING TRADITIONAL AUTHORITIES IN POST-CONFLICT DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IS EXPECTED TO PRESERVE PROGRESSIVE ELEMENTS OF TRADITIONAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION WHILE REFORMING THE DESPOTIC PRACTICES OF SUCH AUTHORITIES. HOWEVER, BEYOND THIS WIDELY-HELD EXPECTATION, THE PEACEBUILDING LITERATURE HAS SO FAR FAILED TO SPECIFY WHICH TRADITIONAL FUNCTIONS ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO CHANGE AND THE MECHANISMS FOR INFORMAL INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE. BASED ON QUALITATIVE FIELDWORK ON TRADITIONAL JUSTICE IN SIERRA LEONE, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT JUDICIAL ROLES WHICH HAVE EMERGED IN RESPONSE TO WEAKNESSES IN THE MODERN STATE SYSTEM CAN BE DESTABILIZED BY POST-CONFLICT INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AIMED AT (RE)BUILDING THE RULE OF LAW. THIS IS BECAUSE THE PROBLEM-SOLVING NEEDS WHICH PRECIPITATED THOSE INFORMAL JUDICIAL FUNCTIONS CAN BE ALTERED BY AN EFFECTIVE STATE SYSTEM AND THE COST MOST LIKELY TO INHIBIT INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IN THIS RECONSTRUCTION CONTEXT IS PARTICULARISTIC TO TRADITIONAL AUTHORITIES. HOWEVER, PREFERENCE FOR TRADITIONAL METHODS AND PRACTICES OUTSIDE THIS ENDOGENOUS RELATIONSHIP RAISES A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION ABOUT SOCIALLY-RELEVANT JUSTICE WHICH CANNOT BE ADDRESSED BY A FUNCTIONAL STATE SYSTEM AND WHOSE DISRUPTION INCURS WIDELY DISPERSED SOCIOCULTURAL COSTS.
260	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF IMPROVEMENTS IN INSTITUTIONAL OVERSIGHT SPECIFICALLY FOR COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS ON ACCRUAL QUALITY IN EUROPE. THE SAMPLE COMPRISES 9339 FIRM-YEAR OBSERVATIONS FROM A TREATMENT SAMPLE OF THREE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT HAD EITHER NON-EXISTENT OR RELATIVELY WEAK INSTITUTIONAL OVERSIGHT SYSTEMS AT THE START OF THE SAMPLE PERIOD 2006-2010 BUT IMPROVED OVERSIGHT SYSTEMS THEREAFTER, AND A BENCHMARK SAMPLE OF SIX OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT HAD INSTITUTIONAL OVERSIGHT SYSTEMS FROM THE START OF THIS SAMPLE PERIOD. AFTER CONTROLLING FOR LEGAL SYSTEM, RULE OF LAW AND OTHER VARIABLES, WE FIND INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENT IN ACCRUAL QUALITY IN THE TREATMENT SAMPLE RELATIVE TO THE BENCHMARK SAMPLE FROM THE PRE-ENFORCEMENT PERIOD 2006-2007 TO THE ENFORCEMENT PERIOD 2008-2010. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT INSTITUTIONAL OVERSIGHT HAS AN INCREMENTALLY POSITIVE IMPACT ON ACCRUAL QUALITY OVER AND ABOVE THAT ATTRIBUTABLE TO LEGAL SYSTEM, RULE OF LAW AND OTHER VARIABLES. THE RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO DIFFERENT MEASURES OF ACCRUAL QUALITY, ALTERNATIVE ENFORCEMENT PROXY AND ALTERNATIVE SAMPLES.
261	THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE SECRECY PROVISIONS EMBODIED IN THE AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT ACT 2003 (CWLTH). THE ARTICLE EXPLAINS HOW THESE PROVISIONS CURB FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND REMOVE ASIO'S ACTIVITIES FROM THE DOMAIN OF PUBLIC SCRUTINY. IT ARGUES THAT BY EFFECTIVELY CRIMINALISING OPEN DISCUSSION OF ASIO'S ACTIVITIES THE PROVISIONS INSULATE MUCH OF THE DOMESTIC 'WAR ON TERROR' FROM THE PUBLIC GAZE. IT ALSO ARGUES THAT THE PROVISIONS IMPLICITLY SANCTION LAWLESSNESS BY ASIO IN OPEN BREACH OF THE RULE OF LAW. BY UNDERMINING FREE SPEECH AND THE RULE OF LAW, THIS LEGISLATION INCREASES THE RISK OF TORTURE OF PERSONS DETAINED BY ASIO. THE LEGISLATION ALSO EXACERBATES THE PUNITIVENESS OF SUCH DETENTION. MOREOVER, THE SECRECY OFFENCES WILL DISTORT AUSTRALIAN POLITICS BY ENABLING THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL AND MANIPULATE 'SECURITY' INFORMATION. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THE INCREASE IN STATE SECRECY AND ITS IMPACT ARE PART OF A CONTINUING SHIFT IN THE RELATIVE DISTRIBUTION OF POWER BETWEEN STATE AND SUBJECT IN LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES; A SHIFT THAT SIGNALS A MOVE TO MORE REPRESSIVE OR AUTHORITARIAN FORMS OF RULE.
262	THE ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW THE CONCEPT OF MODERNISATION MANIFESTS ITSELF IN PARTNERSHIPS FOR MODERNISATION (PS4M) BETWEEN RUSSIA, ON THE ONE HAND, AND THE EU AND 24 OF ITS MEMBER STATES, ON THE OTHER HAND. IT FIRST IDENTIFIES THE CONVENTIONAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RUSSIAN ECONOMIC INTERPRETATION OF MODERNISATION AND THE EU ONE BASED ON POLITICAL VALUES. THE ARTICLE THEN DEMONSTRATES THE AMBIGUITY OF THE MODERNISATION CONCEPT THAT EU MEMBER STATES PROMOTE TO RUSSIA, MAKING IT AN EMPTY SIGNIFIER. TO ILLUSTRATE THE DIFFERENCE AMONG EU MEMBER STATES, THE ARTICLE MAKES USE OF DISCOURSE ANALYSIS TO FIRST DESIGN A SCALE OF RUSSIA'S ATTITUDE TO VARIOUS POLITICAL ASPECTS OF MODERNISATION AND TO THEN POSIT MEMBER STATES ON THIS SCALE ON THE BASIS OF WHAT THEY INSERTED IN THEIR PS4M WITH RUSSIA. IT IS ARGUED THAT RUSSIA IN ITS DIALOGUE WITH THE EU FACES AMBIGUITY OF THE CONCEPT, WHICH IT IS SUPPOSED TO ADOPT. FURTHERMORE, A NEW CLASSIFICATION OF EU MEMBER STATES EMERGES, BASED ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY ARE READY TO DEFEND POLITICAL MODERNISATION (AND ULTIMATELY THE EU'S NORMATIVE POWER) IN THEIR RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA.
263	THE OBJECTIVE OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO CONSIDER THE FORMS OF PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS IN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS. THE METHODOLOGICAL BASIS USED IS PRESENTED AS: COMPARATIVE-LEGAL AND SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS, FORMAL-LEGAL METHOD, HERMENEUTIC METHOD, AS WELL AS METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS. EVERYTHING ALLOWS TO CONCLUDE THAT, IN ORDER TO CLARIFY THE ISSUE OF COMPLIANCE OF METHODS FOR JUDICIAL PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS, PROVIDED BY THE CODE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE OF UKRAINE, WITH THE CRITERIA OF A RULE OF LAW AND THE NEEDS OF ESTABLISHING AT EACH MOMENT THE RULE OF LAW IN CONCRETE REALITY, THE ASSESSMENT OF PROVISIONS OF THE LEGISLATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES OF: AZERBAIJAN, GEORGIA, ESTONIA, LATVIA, POLAND, FRANCE AND THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY. FINALLY, IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS IN UKRAINE HAVE SIGNIFICANT HUMAN RIGHTS POWERS TO MAKE DECISIONS ON RECOVERY OF FUNDS FROM AN AUTHORITY TO COMPENSATE FOR THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY ITS UNLAWFUL ADMINISTRATIVE ACT, IF SUCH A CLAIM IS FILED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE APPLICATION FOR RECOGNITION OF SUCH ACT AS UNLAWFUL.
264	THE NATIONALISTIC, XENOPHOBIC, MISOGYNISTIC, AND EXPLICITLY ANTI-HUMAN RIGHTS AGENDA OF MANY POPULIST POLITICAL LEADERS REQUIRES HUMAN RIGHTS PROPONENTS TO RETHINK MANY LONGSTANDING ASSUMPTIONS. THERE IS A NEED TO RE-EVALUATE STRATEGIES AND BROADEN OUTREACH, WHILE REAFFIRMING THE BASIC PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THE HUMAN RIGHTS MOVEMENT IS FOUNDED. AMONGST THE CHALLENGES ARE THE NEED TO ACHIEVE MORE EFFECTIVE SYNERGIES BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL AND LOCAL HUMAN RIGHTS MOVEMENTS AND TO EMBRACE AND ASSERT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RIGHTS AS HUMAN RIGHTS RATHER THAN AS WELFARE OR DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES. IT WILL BE CRUCIAL TO ENGAGE WITH ISSUES OF RESOURCES AND REDISTRIBUTION, INCLUDING BUDGETS, TAX POLICY, AND FISCAL POLICIES. THERE IS A NEED FOR COLLABORATION WITH A BROADER RANGE OF ACTORS, TO BE MORE PERSUASIVE AND LESS DIDACTIC, AND TO BE PREPARED TO BREAK WITH SOME OF THE OLD CERTAINTIES. ACADEMICS SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR SCHOLARSHIP, AND EVERYONE IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS MOVEMENT NEEDS TO REFLECT ON THE CONTRIBUTIONS EACH CAN MAKE.
265	IN CONTRAST TO MOST EXISTING LITERATURE, THE AUTHOR CLAIMS THAT THERE WERE PALPABLE 'RUDIMENTS' OF AUTHORITARIAN SOCIALIST RECHTSSTAAT IN SOME COMMUNIST COUNTRIES OF EAST CENTRAL EUROPE IN THE LATE 1980S. THE FIRST PART OF THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE EXISTING TERMINOLOGY WITH REGARD TO THE FUNCTIONING OF LAW IN COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIPS AND AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES IN GENERAL. BY USING THE EXAMPLE OF COMMUNIST COUNTRIES SUCH AS POLAND AND IN PARTICULAR CZECHOSLOVAKIA, THE AUTHOR STRIVES TO SHOW NOT ONLY HOW RULE BY LAW WAS AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT RULING INSTRUMENT IN STATE SOCIALISM BUT ALSO HOW THAT GRADUALLY CHANGED THE NATURE OF THE DICTATORIAL REGIMES. HE ARGUES THAT THE LATE COMMUNIST LEADERSHIPS IN THESE COUNTRIES HAPHAZARDLY SET OUT TOWARDS AN AUTHORITARIAN SOCIALIST RECHTSSTAAT IN AN EFFORT TO SAFE THEIR GRIP ON POWER BY STRENGTHENING THE SOCIALIST NORMATIVE STATE. THEY NEVER ARRIVED AT THE ENVISIONED OPTIMAL STAGE IN THIS RESPECT, YET THEY OPENED A FATEFUL PATH INSIDE THE DICTATORSHIPS TOWARDS THE LEGALIST AND NEGOTIATED REVOLUTIONS OF 1989.
266	THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S POLICY ON THE CENTRALISED ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM (CONTAINED IN ART. 226 EC) IN THE LIGHT OF ITS ESPOUSED COMMITMENT TO GOOD GOVERNANCE AND LEGITIMACY WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE COMMISSION'S INITIAL EFFORTS IN 2002 TO REFORM ITS HANDLING OF THE INFRINGEMENT PROCESS IN THE LIGHT OF ITS OWN PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNANCE (OPENNESS, PARTICIPATION, EFFECTIVENESS, COHERENCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY) WERE AN INTERESTING, ALTHOUGH INCOMPLETE, ATTEMPT TO RECONCILE THE TRADITIONALLY CLOSED AND SECRETIVE PROCESS OF ENFORCEMENT OF MEMBER STATES' OBLIGATIONS WITH THE TWIN AGENDA OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AND BRINGING THE EUROPEAN UNION CLOSER TO ITS CITIZENS. AS A UNIQUE SPACE OF INTERACTION FOR A MULTITUDE OF ACTORS, ART. 226 EC PRESENTS A VALUABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PERCEIVED UNACCOUNTABLE EU INSTITUTIONS TO DELIVER VALUABLE INTER-INSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY. THE GLARING OMISSION FROM THE COMMISSION'S INITIAL COMMUNICATION WAS AN INDICATION OF ITS STRATEGY FOR COPING WITH AN ENLARGED EUROPEAN UNION. THE RECENT COMMUNICATION (SEPTEMBER 2007) FROM THE COMMISSION ATTEMPTS TO DEAL WITH THIS OMISSION. INSTEAD OF CONTINUING WITH ITS COMMITMENT TO GOOD GOVERNANCE, IT IS ARGUED THAT THE COMMUNICATION COULD BE SEEN AS THE FINAL BLOW TO ANY HOPE THAT THE COMMISSION'S HANDLING OF THE INFRINGEMENT PROCESS COULD BE LEGITIMISED IN ITS OWN GOOD GOVERNANCE TERMS. THE STRATEGY SEEMS TO HAVE TURNED INEXORABLY TOWARD OUTSOURCING THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DEALING WITH COMPLAINANTS TO THE MEMBER STATES, NOT AS A WAY OF DEALING WITH A VAST INCREASE IN NUMBERS OF COMPLAINTS, BUT IN ORDER TO CIRCUMVENT ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS BEING PLACED ON THE COMMISSION'S DISCRETION.
267	PUBLIC/SOCIAL RELATIONS DETERMINE THE NATURE OF SOCIETY, ETHNO-NATIONAL GROUPS AND COMMUNITIES OF PEOPLE, AN INDIVIDUAL, DETERMINE HIS/HER PLACE IN THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL SPACE, GUARANTEE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS. THE SPACE OF COMMUNICATION FORMS AND ENSURES THE REALIZATION OF A PERSON'S CAPABILITIES, ENSURING HIS/HER RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, SATISFYING HIS/HER NEEDS, FULFILLING HIS/HER ASPIRATIONS AND HOPES, TRANSLATING IDEALS INTO THE PRACTICE OF EVERYDAY LIFE. AT THE SAME TIME, SPECIAL TASKS ARE ASSIGNED TO LEGAL SCIENCE AS A MEANS AND MECHANISM FOR REGULATING PUBLIC/SOCIAL RELATIONS, LEGAL SOCIALIZATION OF A HUMAN, ENSURING HIS/HER RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, HIS/HER FORMATION AS A PERSON, A CITIZEN OF THE COUNTRY, AS A FULL-FLEDGED REPRESENTATIVE OF CIVIL SOCIETY. IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE, THE TERMS "PUBLIC" AND "SOCIAL" ARE USED BOTH TO REFER TO THE SAME PHENOMENA, EVENTS AND PROCESSES (LACK OF IDENTIFICATION), AND VARIOUS SOCIAL PHENOMENA. IN OTHER CASES, THE SOCIAL IS IDENTIFIED WITH THE PUBLIC. AS A RULE, THIS TAKES PLACE IN TWO CASES: IN THE CASE OF COMPREHENDING THE ENTIRETY OF PHENOMENA AND PROCESSES THAT EXIST IN A PARTICULAR SOCIETY, AS WELL AS IN CASES OF EMPHASIS ON THE DIFFERENCES THAT DISTINGUISH SOCIAL PHENOMENA AND PROCESSES FROM NATURAL, TECHNICAL, TECHNOLOGICAL AND INFORMATIONAL. THIS APPROACH, WHICH CAN BE DEFINED AS A BROAD ONE, UNDERSTANDS SOCIAL RELATIONS AS ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND IDEOLOGICAL PHENOMENA AND PROCESSES, WHILE PUBLIC RELATIONS ARE DETERMINED AS SOCIAL ONES.
268	THE INTER-AMERICAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPED A DOCTRINE CALLED CONVENTIONALITY CONTROL. IN GENERAL TERMS, THIS DOCTRINE IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE IDEA OF JUDICIAL REVIEW OF LEGISLATION, BUT APPLIED IN A TRANSNATIONAL FORUM. ACCORDING TO THE COURT, CONVENTIONALITY CONTROL WOULD REQUIRE DOMESTIC JUDGES AND OTHER BODIES OF STATES PARTIES TO THE AMERICAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS (ACHR) TO DEPART FROM DOMESTIC LEGISLATION THAT RUNS COUNTER TO THE ACHR OR THE INTER-AMERICAN COURT'S INTERPRETATION OF THE ACHR. MANY SCHOLARS CONTEND THAT THE APPLICATION OF THIS DOCTRINE SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT EVEN IF THE DOMESTIC BODIES THAT APPLY IT HAVE NO CONSTITUTIONAL POWER TO DO SO. OTHERS HAVE A MORE RESTRICTIVE INTERPRETATION AND CONSIDER THAT DOMESTIC BODIES WOULD HAVE TO APPLY IT TO THE EXTENT OF THEIR POWER, ACCORDING TO THEIR NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONS. APPARENTLY, THE LATTER INTERPRETATION IS GAINING A WIDER SUPPORT, WHICH IS DESIRABLE, BECAUSE ONLY THIS READING WOULD BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND POSSIBLY ACCEPTED BY ALL MEMBER STATES.
269	AFTER MORE THAN 60 YEARS OF DEVELOPMENT, THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA HAS ESTABLISHED THE WORLD'S LARGEST SIZE OF LEGAL EDUCATION, WITH 624 LAW SCHOOLS AND 450,000 THOUSANDS OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS CURRENTLY ENROLLED. AS WENHUA SHAN EXPLAINS, WHILST THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION HAS ALSO BEEN IMPROVED, IT GENERALLY FALLS SHORT OF MEETING THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CHALLENGES THAT CHINA IS FACING IN LEGAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE. THE MOST IMPORTANT MEASURE RECENTLY ADOPTED BY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF LEGAL EDUCATION, THE "OUTSTANDING LEGAL PERSONNEL EDUCATION SCHEME", IS POISED TO BRING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE STRUCTURE, CONTENTS AND METHODS OF CHINESE LEGAL EDUCATION; AND IT WILL BOOST DEEPER COOPERATION BETWEEN LAW SCHOOLS AND THE PRACTICE SECTORS. FURTHER MEASURES ARE NEVERTHELESS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED RESULTS OF THE SCHEME AND TO PLACE CHINESE LEGAL EDUCATION IN AN INTERNATIONALLY COMPETITIVE POSITION.
270	AS AN OBJECTIVE IN INTERNATIONAL LEGAL COOPERATION, INTERVENTIONS WITH THE AIM TO ENHANCE ACCESS TO JUSTICE ARE A RELATIVELY NEW PHENOMENON THAT HAS FAMOUSLY BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE 'LEGAL EMPOWERMENT ALTERNATIVE' WHICH GOES 'BEYOND THE RULE OF LAW ORTHODOXY'. GENERALLY SPEAKING, WHILE TRADITIONAL APPROACHES PRIMARILY AIM AT PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW 'TOP-DOWN' BY STRENGTHENING STATE STRUCTURES AND CAPACITIES, ACCESS TO JUSTICE PROJECTS TAKE A 'BOTTOM-UP' APPROACH FOCUSING ON THE EMPOWERMENT OF 'USERS' OF JUSTICE SYSTEMS. THE OVERARCHING THEORY OF CHANGE BEHIND THIS APPROACH IS THAT EMPOWERED CITIZENS ARE BETTER ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL, HELPING BUILD GREATER TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, PARTICULARLY IN FRAGILE AND CONFLICT-AFFECTED SITUATIONS. FOCUSING ON THE PROVISION OF LEGAL AID SERVICES, THIS ARTICLE OUTLINES THE INTERNATIONAL NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK, DEPICTS THE VARIOUS PRACTICAL APPROACHES, AND REFLECTS SOME FINDINGS RESULTING FROM A RECENT EVALUATION COMMISSIONED BY THE GERMAN FEDERAL FOREIGN OFFICE ON ITS ENGAGEMENT IN ENHANCING ACCESS TO JUSTICE, DRAWING FROM EXAMPLES IN PALESTINE, UKRAINE, AND PAKISTAN.
271	THE "FUSION STRATEGY" FORMULATED BY MICHAEL S. MOORE IS A KIND OF A SKEPTICAL ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF THE ONTOLOGY OF LAW. FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF PROFESSOR MOORE, THE THEORY OF LEGAL LANGUAGE BY HERBERT HART IS ONE OF THE VARIANTS OF THE "FUSION". ON CLOSER EXAMINATION, WE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT SKEPTICISM, WHICH IS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE "FUSION" OF THE MEANING OF A WORD WITH A SENTENCE, IS RELEVANT ONLY WHEN WE INSIST ON THE VARIANT OF NATURALISTIC LEGAL ONTOLOGY. FOR LEGALLY SIGNIFICANT TERMS, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE REFERENT IF THEY ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE. THE THEORY OF THE ASCRIPTIONS OF LEGAL EXPRESSION OPENS UP NEW PERSPECTIVES FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A LEGAL ONTOLOGY. AN EXAMPLE IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND LAW ENFORCEMENT: IF A RULE OF LAW IS A RULE THAT DETERMINES A CERTAIN COURSE OF ACTION, THEN THE SPECIFIC SITUATION OF USING THE LEGAL LANGUAGE ALLOWS ESTABLISHING A CONNECTION BETWEEN LANGUAGE AND REALITY. CONSEQUENTLY, HART'S THEORY IS WRONG TO QUALIFY AS SKEPTICAL.
272	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE POSSIBILITIES OF RETRIBUTIVE AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE APPROACHES TO THE VICTIM-PERPETRATOR RELATIONSHIP BY USING AN EXTREME EXAMPLE, THAT IS, THE 1994 RWANDAN GENOCIDE, AND THE ATTEMPTS MADE BY RWANDANS AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ESTABLISH THE RULE OF LAW IN ITS AFTERMATH. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE BREAKDOWN OF THE RULE OF LAW AND OF RWANDAN SOCIETY THAT ENABLED THE 1994 GENOCIDE IN RWANDA, WAS BROUGHT ABOUT BY A PROCESS OF FRAMING, THAT IS, "ETHNIC FRAMING". IT WILL BE ARGUED THAT THE ACT OF FRAMING DEHUMANISED THE FRAMED OBJECT, THE VICTIM, TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT VIOLENCE, EVEN GENOCIDE, WAS AN ACCEPTABLE REACTION TO IT AND DIALOGUE WITH BOTH SIDES IS NEEDED TO REHUMANISE THE FRAMED. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RETRIBUTIVE JUSTICE IN TRANSFORMING THE VICTIM-PERPETRATOR RELATIONSHIP TO DESTROY RWANDA'S "ETHNIC FRAMING" WILL BE EXAMINED. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE, IN PARTICULAR, TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSIONS, WILL ALSO BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO RETRIBUTIVE JUSTICE. THE RWANDAN HYBRID OF RESTORATIVE AND RETRIBUTIVE JUSTICE, THE GACACA COURTS, WILL ALSO BE BRIEFLY EXAMINED.
273	INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS ARE CURRENTLY TAKING PLACE, IN A VARIETY OF FORMS, IN AREAS AS DIVERSE AS KOSOVO, CAMBODIA, AND SIERRA LEONE. WHILE EACH ACCOUNTABILITY SCHEME MUST BE TAILORED TO THE SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH CASE, A TREND EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF DOMESTIC INVOLVEMENT IN THESE PROSECUTIONS HAS RECENTLY EMERGED. THIS TREND IS PREMISED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT BUILDING THE RULE OF LAW DOMESTICALLY IS THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE LASTING PEACE AND STABILITY IN COUNTRIES RAVAGED BY MASS ATROCITY. IN THE ERA OF THE ICC, A METHOD FOR INCORPORATING THE DOMESTIC SYSTEM, IN LIGHT OF THE SHORTCOMINGS OF PURELY INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNALS AND THE COMPLEMENTARITY REGIME OF THE ROME STATUTE, HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY CRITICAL. DRAWING ON A CASE STUDY OF THE SITUATION IN THE WESTERN SUDANESE PROVINCE OF DARFUR, THIS NOTE DEMONSTRATES HOW DOMESTIC INVOLVEMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED GIVEN THE STATUTORY CONSTRAINTS OF THE ROME STATUTE AND THE PURPORTED INVOLVEMENT OF THE CURRENT SUDANESE GOVERNMENT IN PERPETRATING THE ATROCITIES. THIS APPROACH, INVOLVING A HYBRID-ICC TRIBUNAL, ALLOWS FOR STRENGTHENING OF THE DOMESTIC RULE OF LAW WHILE ENSURING FAIRNESS AND IMPARTIALITY.
274	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS AN OVERVIEW OF THE COMPETENCES OF THE RECENTLY ESTABLISHED EUROPEAN PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE ("EPPO"), A SUPRANATIONAL BODY THAT INVESTIGATES AND PROSECUTES CRIMINAL OFFENCES AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL INTERESTS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ("EU"). VARIOUS ASPECTS RELATED TO CRIMINAL PROCEDURE AND SUBSTANTIVE CRIMINAL LAW WILL BE DISCUSSED WITH A VIEW TO EXPLAIN HOW THE EPPO IS EMBEDDED IN THE NATIONAL JUDICIAL SYSTEMS DESPITE ITS SUPRANATIONAL ORIGIN. AMONG THE MATTERS TO BE EXAMINED WILL BE THE REQUIREMENT TO PROSECUTE CRIME EFFICIENTLY WHILE ENSURING THAT THE PROCEDURAL RIGHTS OF THE SUSPECTS AND THE ACCUSED PERSONS WILL BE DULY RESPECTED. A PARTICULAR FOCUS WILL BE ON THE COOPERATION WITH OTHER EU ENTITIES AND NATIONAL AUTHORITIES BOTH IN THE MEMBER STATES AS WELL AS IN THIRD COUNTRIES. THE ELEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ARTICLE SHALL ALLOW THE READER TO ASSESS WHETHER THE EPPO HAS MET THE OBJECTIVES SET BY THE EU LEGISLATOR.
275	EUROPE IS GRADUALLY EMBRACING FREEDOM OF INFORMATION PRINCIPLES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME RESTRICTING DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION GENERATED BY PUBLIC AGENCIES THROUGH ELECTRONIC DATABASES. BOTH BRITAIN AND GERMANY ARE MOVING TO ADOPT FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LAWS, AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS PUBLISHED A REGULATION ALLOWING ACCESS TO EUROPEAN INSTITUTION MATERIALS. THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, BECAUSE THE INTERNET IS ALREADY BECOMING A VAST VIRTUAL LIBRARY FACILITATING GLOBAL ACCESS TO STATUTES, COURT DECISIONS, AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY DECISIONS THAT MAKE UP THE RAW INGREDIENTS OF A RULE OF LAW. MEANWHILE, HOWEVER, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ISSUED A DIRECTIVE LIMITING CERTAIN USES OF ELECTRONIC DATABASES, BROADLY ENOUGH DRAFTED TO INCLUDE ELECTRONIC REPOSITORIES OF PRIMARY LEGAL INFORMATION. THIS KIND OF STATE-SPONSORED MONOPOLY OVER PUBLIC INFORMATION IS INIMICAL TO A RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRATIC VALUES. EUROPEANS AND AMERICANS SHOULD WORK TO REALIZE THE INCREASED TRANSPARENCY PROMISED BY THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION DEVELOPMENTS, AND WORK TO MINIMIZE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE DATABASE DIRECTIVE AND SIMILAR PROPOSALS ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC RESTRICT REDISSEMINATION OF PRIMARY LEGAL INFORMATION.
276	THE PROCEDURE FOR INFRINGEMENT OF (WHAT IS NOW) EUROPEAN UNION (EU) LAW HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF THE COMMUNITIES. YET IT HAS NOT REMAINED UNCHANGED, MOST RECENTLY BEING AMENDED BY THE TREATY OF LISBON. OVER A DECADE LATER, AND WITH CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE APPLICATION OF FINANCIAL SANCTIONS AND IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN MEMBER STATES, IT BECOMES PRESSING TO EVALUATE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE AMENDMENTS. CONSEQUENTLY, THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES FIRSTLY WHETHER THE INFRINGEMENT PROCESS IS NOW PLAYING AN INCREASING ROLE IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EU LAW-NOT ONLY IN RELATION TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AMENDMENTS IN THE TREATY OF LISBON, BUT ALSO IN LIGHT OF RECENT CASE LAW ON STRENGTHENING INTERIM MEASURES IN INFRINGEMENT PROCEEDINGS. SECONDLY, THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF THE INFRINGEMENT PROCEEDINGS UPON THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN THE UNION. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS WHETHER CHANGING THE DIVISION OF JURISDICTION BETWEEN THE EU COURTS IN THE INFRINGEMENT PROCEEDINGS WOULD HELP OR HINDER THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EU LAW.
277	THE ARTICLE PROVIDES A COMPARATIVE OVERVIEW OF TAX AUDIT IN CROATIA AND SLOVENIA AND POINTS OUT THE NEED TO DISTINGUISH THE TERM TAX AUDIT FROM OTHER TYPES OF TAX AUDITING -CONTROL, INSPECTION, OR MONITORING IN TAX LAW. THERE ARE OTHER TYPES OR FORMS AND PROCEDURES OF MONITORING IN THE TAX AREA BESIDES TAX AUDIT, STRICTO SENSU. THE POSITION OF A TAXPAYER AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE TAX AUDIT PARTICIPANTS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER TYPES OF AUDITING IN TAX LAW. ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS TO IDENTIFYING AND SOLVING THE CHALLENGES OF TAX AUDIT IN CROATIA AND SLOVENIA IS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT TYPES OF MONITORING TAX REGULATIONS DEFINE, SINCE THE POSITIONS OF THE TAX AUTHORITY AND THE TAXPAYER ARE NOT THE SAME WHEN IT COMES TO DIFFERENT AUDITING PROCEDURES. DUE TO THE AMBIGUITIES IN PRACTICE, THE NEED FOR A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH AND CLEAR DIFFERENTIATION OF THE TYPES OF TAX AUDITING IS INDICATED WITH THE GOAL OF ACHIEVING LEGAL CERTAINTY AND LEGALITY IN TAXATION.
278	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AIMS TO MAINTAIN SOCIAL STABILITY BY ENCOURAGING CITIZENS TO BECOME VOLUNTEERS. WE PROPOSE THAT A NEW TYPE OF GOVERNANCE, NAMELY, "STATE-ENLISTED VOLUNTARISM," IS BEING DEPLOYED IN WHICH PUBLIC SECURITY VOLUNTEERS ARE MOBILIZED AND MONITORED BY THE STATE. ANALYSIS BASED ON TEN-YEAR NATIONWIDE EMPIRICAL DATA GATHERED FROM LOCAL AREAS IN CHINA SUGGESTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT INTENTIONALLY ENLISTS CITIZENS INTO ITS HIERARCHICAL SYSTEM TO STRENGTHEN ITS ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY AND MAINTAIN A STABLE SOCIETY WITHOUT THE RISK OF DOMESTIC THREATS. WE FIND THAT DIRECT ENLISTMENT APPROACHES EMPOWER CITIZENS AS STATE PROXIES, AND THAT INDIRECT ENLISTMENT APPROACHES ENSURE THAT VARIOUS SOCIAL STAKEHOLDERS ARE COMPREHENSIVELY CONTROLLED. IN GENERAL, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS FOUR REASONS TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THE STATE ENLISTMENT OF VOLUNTARISM: TO INCREASE HUMAN RESOURCES AT THE GRASSROOTS; TRANSFORM SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS INTO SUBORDINATES; FRAME POLICY INNOVATIONS AS POLITICAL CREDITS; AND TO AVOID BLAME. OUR FINDINGS ALSO SUGGEST THAT CHINA'S PARTY-STATE SYSTEM MOBILIZES CITIZENS INTO IMPLEMENTATION-ORIENTED ACTIVITIES RATHER THAN ENGAGES THEM IN POLICYMAKING TO MAINTAIN SOCIAL STABILITY AT THE GRASSROOTS.
279	THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT IN KYRGYZSTAN ESTABLISHED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM OF APRIL 11, 2021, IDENTIFIES ITS MOST IMPORTANT ESSENTIAL FEATURES AND SHORTCOMINGS, AND ATTEMPTS TO PRECISE ITS SCIENTIFIC CLASSIFICATION. THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF THE FUNCTIONING OF THE NEW FORM OF GOVERNMENT ARE INDICATED. ON APRIL 11, 2021, A CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM WAS HELD IN KYRGYZSTAN, AT WHICH AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE WERE APPROVED. ON THE SAME DAY, THE ELECTIONS OF THE PRESIDENT OF KYRGYZSTAN WERE HELD, WHICH WERE WON BY THE ACTING PRESIDENT, POLITICIAN SADYR ZHAPAROV. THIS CLEARLY INDICATED THE ROLE OF THE SUBJECTIVE FACTOR IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS. THE CHANGES CONCERNED ALL SECTIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND MARKED THE EMERGENCE OF A VIRTUALLY NEW CONSTITUTION OF KYRGYZSTAN. THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES WAS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW ECLECTIC FORM OF GOVERNMENT WITH AN EXAGGERATED CONSTITUTIONAL STATUS OF THE PRESIDENT. IN THIS FORM OF GOVERNMENT, THE PRESIDENT COMBINED IN HIS PERSON THE FUNCTIONS OF HEAD OF STATE AND HEAD OF EXECUTIVE POWER, ADMINISTRATIVELY SUBJUGATED THE GOVERNMENT AND DEPRIVED IT OF THE STATUS OF AN INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY.
280	HOW DO WE EXPLAIN VARIATION IN JUDICIAL ASSERTIVENESS TOWARDS POLITICALLY POWERFUL MILITARIES? THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE JUDICIARY'S WILLINGNESS TO ASSERT ITSELF AGAINST THE MILITARY IS CONTINGENT UPON THE TYPE OF MILITARY PREROGATIVE BEING CHALLENGED. FOCUSING ON PAKISTAN, I FIND THAT COURTS ARE MORE WILLING TO CONTEST MILITARY PREROGATIVES CONNECTED TO THE MILITARY'S POLITICAL AUTHORITY, THAN PREROGATIVES CONNECTED TO ITS INSTITUTIONAL AUTONOMY. THIS SELECTIVE ASSERTIVENESS IS STRATEGIC, AS CONCERNS ABOUT MILITARY RETALIATION AGAINST THE JUDICIARY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OUTWEIGH JUDICIAL PREFERENCES, ON QUESTIONS OF THE MILITARY'S INSTITUTIONAL AUTONOMY THAN ON QUESTIONS OF THE MILITARY'S POLITICAL AUTHORITY. I TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS USING AN ORIGINAL DATASET OF 720 HIGH COURT AND SUPREME COURT JUDGMENTS PERTAINING TO MILITARY PREROGATIVES FROM PAKISTAN. I THEN DISCUSS A SAMPLE OF JUDGMENTS SELECTED FROM THE DATASET TO DEMONSTRATE HOW VARIATION IN JUDICIAL ASSERTIVENESS IS GUIDED PRIMARILY BY STRATEGIC CONCERNS ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF MILITARY RETALIATION AGAINST THE JUDICIARY. IN STUDYING THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE JUDICIARY AND THE MILITARY IN PAKISTAN, THE ARTICLE PROVIDES A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON THE SOURCES OF JUDICIAL ASSERTIVENESS AND RESTRAINT, AND THE ROLE THE JUDICIARY CAN PLAY IN BRINGING MILITARIES UNDER CIVILIAN CONTROL IN AUTHORITARIAN AND POST-AUTHORITARIAN STATES.
281	THE PATIENT OMBUDSMAN SCHEME IN NORWAY HAS GRADUALLY BEEN ESTABLISHED OVER THE LAST 25 YEARS, AND HAS ITS BASIS IN THE PATIENTS' RIGHTS ACT. THE 18 OMBUDSMEN ARE OBLIGED TO ASSIST ALL USERS OF HEALTH SERVICES. THE QUESTION MAINLY TO BE DEALT WITH IS TWOFOLD: IN WHICH WAYS ARE THE AIMS OF THE PATIENT OMBUDSMEN SCHEME ATTENDED TO BY THE OMBUDSMEN? WHAT DO THE OMBUDSMEN LOOK UPON AS KEY ELEMENTS IN BUILDING A FUNCTIONAL SYSTEM? THIS IS EXAMINED BY MEANS OF DATA FROM THE NORWEGIAN SOCIAL SCIENCE DATA SERVICES, THE NORWEGIAN BOARD OF HEALTH SUPERVISION AND FROM A QUESTIONNAIRE PRESENTED TO THE OMBUDSMEN. BESIDES GIVING INFORMATION THE OMBUDSMEN TAKE ROLES AS ADVISORS, MEDIATORS, ADVOCATES AND ARBITRATORS. AMONG THE KEY ELEMENTS IN BUILDING A WELL FUNCTIONING SCHEME THE OMBUDSMEN IN PARTICULAR MENTIONED; WORKING INDEPENDENTLY OF HEALTH CARE AUTHORITIES, THE RIGHT TO INVESTIGATE CASES, AND THE POSSIBILITY TO MAKE USE OF THE SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY.
282	THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE DUTY OF STATE ENTITIES TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN JUDGMENTS IN THE FELD OF ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS, BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RIGHT TO EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION, EXAMINING THE PROJECTIONS OF THAT RIGHT ARISING FROM THE PROVISIONS OF THE URUGUAYAN CONSTITUTION AND THE PACT OF SAN JOSE DE COSTA RICA.
283	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE ON CAPITAL FLIGHT BY BUNDLING AND UNBUNDLING GOVERNANCE. THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS BASED ON 37 AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 1996-2010 AND THE GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENTS. GOVERNANCE IS BUNDLED BY PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS, NAMELY: (I) POLITICAL GOVERNANCE FROM POLITICAL STABILITY AND 'VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY'; (II) ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE FROM GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND REGULATION QUALITY AND (III) INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE FROM CORRUPTION-CONTROL AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS ARE ESTABLISHED. (I) POLITICAL STABILITY AND 'VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY' REDUCE CAPITAL FLIGHT WHILE THE COLLECTIVE EFFECT OF POLITICAL GOVERNANCE IS NOT SIGNIFICANT. (II) ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE INCREASES CAPITAL FLIGHT WHEREAS THE INDIVIDUAL EFFECTS OF REGULATION QUALITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT. (III) CORRUPTION-CONTROL AND INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE NEGATIVELY AFFECT CAPITAL FLIGHT WHEREAS THE IMPACT OF THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT SIGNIFICANT. (IV) TAKEN TOGETHER, CORRUPTION- CONTROL IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE WEAPON IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CAPITAL FLIGHT. (V) PRIORITY IN THE WASHINGTON CONSENSUS IS MORE EFFECTIVE AT FIGHTING CAPITAL FLIGHT COMPARED TO THE BEIJING MODEL. POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED.
284	U.S. SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BENJAMIN CARDOZO, COMMENTING ON THE PERVERSITY OF THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE, CONTEMPTUOUSLY REMARKED-"THE CRIMINAL IS TO GO FREE BECAUSE THE CONSTABLE HAS BLUNDERED." CARDOZO UNDERSTOOD THAT "FIDELITY TO LAW" MEANT HAVING LAW PRACTICALLY APPLY TO REAL LIFE SITUATIONS. IN THIS ARTICLE THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT IN A POST-9/11 WORLD ONE CAN NO LONGER CONSIDER LEGITIMATE LAW JUDICIAL ACTIVIST DECISIONS THAT SEPARATES LAW FROM MORALITY-JUDICIAL IDEAS READ INTO THE US CONSTITUTION WITHOUT ANY RELIANCE TO THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE FRAMERS OF THE CONSTITUTION, THUS MAKING A MOCKERY OF THE RULE OF LAW (MIRANDA V. ARIZONA, ET AL.,). THIS IS THE CENTENNIAL YEAR SINCE THE FIRST CASE THAT HERALDED THE PRACTICE OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM IN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW IN MODERN TIMES [LOCHNER V. NEW YORK (1905)]-A DECISION WHERE THE COURTS IN SUBSEQUENT DECADES CONSCIOUSLY, ARROGANTLY, AND SYSTEMATICALLY DISPENSED WITH FINDING JUDICIAL PRECEDENT (E.G., STARE DECISIS) TO BASE THEIR OPINION UPON, AND REPLACED THE RULE OF LAW WITH THEIR OWN PERSONAL POLICY PREFERENCES.
285	A GROWING NUMBER OF STATES HAVE MODIFIED CONSTITUTIONALLY DETERMINED PRESIDENTIAL TERM LIMITS OR ADOPTED A FLEXIBLE INTERPRETATION OF RELEVANT CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS TO ALLOW INCUMBENT LEADERS ADDITIONAL TERMS IN THE HIGHEST OFFICE. THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES AFRICAN UNION (AU) RESPONSES TO ATTEMPTS TO OVERTURN OR WEAKEN TERM LIMITS ON EXECUTIVE POWER, ONE OF THE MOST TENACIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL TRENDS IN AFRICA. INSPIRED BY THE AU'S WELL-ESTABLISHED DISCOURSE ON "UNCONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES OF GOVERNMENT" UNDER THE AFRICAN CHARTER ON DEMOCRACY, ELECTIONS AND GOVERNANCE, THE ARTICLE FRAMES THE MANIPULATION OF PRESIDENTIAL TERM LIMITS AS "UNDEMOCRATIC CHANGES OF THE CONSTITUTION". FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE IT ARGUES FOR A MORE ACTIVE ROLE FOR THE AU IN MONITORING AND ENFORCING CONSTITUTIONALISM AND RESPECT FOR DEMOCRATIC STANDARDS BY MEMBER STATES WHEN THEY AMEND THEIR CONSTITUTION. IT CONCLUDES WITH A TENTATIVE SET OF PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE PROCESSES OF CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IN AFRICA.
286	IN SEPTEMBER 2014, A LARGE-SCALE UNPRECEDENTED DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT, COMMONLY CALLED THE UMBRELLA REVOLUTION/MOVEMENT, BROKE OUT IN HONG KONG. ITS OCCUPYING PHASE LASTED FOR 79 DAYS. DURING THIS PERIOD, POLICE INTERVENED VIOLENTLY IN NUMEROUS OCCASIONS. BEING AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THIS MOVEMENT WHO EXPERIENCED POLICE VIOLENCE, GOT ARRESTED AND WAS CONDITIONALLY RELEASED AFTERWARDS, THE AUTHOR HAS SELECTED 39 POLICE-RELATED STATEMENTS UTTERED BY VARIOUS PARTIES DURING THE MOVEMENT AND ATTEMPTS TO CONDUCT A PRELIMINARY DISCOURSE ANALYSIS ANALYZING THEIR RELATIONSHIPS (INCLUDING THEIR OBJECTS, SITES OF UTTERANCE, SPEAKERS' POSITIONS IN RELATION TO LISTENERS, SEQUENCE, MUTUAL RESPONSE, AND THEMATIC CHOICES), THEREBY EXHIBITING HONG KONG'S DISCURSIVE FORMATION THAT RENDERS THESE STATEMENTS POSSIBLE. AS THE ANALYSIS UNFOLDS, ONE WILL NOTICE HOW THE EXTREME IMBALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN THE ESTABLISHMENT AND THE PEOPLE CAN HELP PRODUCE DISCOURSES SO TWISTED AS TO REACH THE POINT OF DEFYING LOGIC AND COMMON SENSE. IN SPITE OF THE WEAK VOICES OF RESISTANCE, THE UTTERANCE OF WHICH IS THE INEVITABLE RESULT OF SUCH AN IMBALANCE, PRO-ESTABLISHMENT VOICES ARE JUST TOO OVERWHELMING, SHOCKING AND DISORIENTING OF THE SENSES OF ORDINARY HONG KONG CITIZENS. BY THIS ANALYSIS, THE AUTHOR IS ALSO MAKING A DESPERATE APPEAL TO THE INTELLECTUAL COMMUNITY TO CONTINUE THEIR CONCERN FOR HONG KONG AND ITS PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY ON HONG KONG'S PROGRESS OF POLITICAL REFORM AND HUMAN RIGHTS CONDITIONS.
287	SOME AUTHORS ARGUE THAT THE RULE-OF-LAW IDEAL GIVES JUDGES A PRIMA FACIE DUTY TO PROVIDE A DETERMINATE FORMULATION OF THE PRECEDENT'S GENERAL NORM IN ALL THEIR PRECEDENT-OPINIONS. I QUESTION THAT CLAIM. I AGREE THAT JUDGES HAVE A DUTY TO DECIDE THEIR CASES BASED ON REASONS AND THAT THEY SHOULD FORMULATE THESE REASONS IN THEIR OPINIONS. I ALSO AGREE THAT FORMULATIONS OF GENERAL NORMS SHOULD BE THE GOAL OF COMMON-LAW DEVELOPMENT AND THAT JUDGES HAVE A DUTY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE REALIZATION OF THIS GOAL. HOWEVER, I ARGUE THAT JUDGES MAY SOMETIMES DO SO BETTER IF THEY DO NOT PROVIDE A DETERMINATE FORMULATION OF A GENERAL NORM IN THEIR OPINION. OFTEN, JUDGES MAY NOT FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO FORMULATE A GOOD GENERAL NORM FOR THEIR PRECEDENT DECISION, EVEN IF THEY BELIEVE THAT THEIR DECISION IS BOTH CORRECT AND JUSTIFIABLE THROUGH ARGUMENT. IN THIS CASE, VARIOUS REASONS SPEAK AGAINST PROVIDING A DETERMINATE FORMULATION OF A GENERAL NORM, INCLUDING RULE-OF-LAW REASONS.
288	THE ARTICLE DEVELOPS A THEORY OF THE SYMPTOM AND ARGUES FOR A SYMPTOMAL ANALYSIS OF CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL SITUATIONS, IN PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT RESONATE WITH EXCEPTION. BY FOCUSING ON GUANTANAMO DETAINEES AND HABEAS CORPUS PETITIONS, THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE LANGUAGE OF LAW AND PUBLIC ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE CLOSURE OF THE FACILITY. THE ARTICLE SHOWS HOW THE LEGAL SITUATION OF DETAINEES POST-2010 IS DETERMINED NOT BY THE BINARY DISTINCTIONS (IDENTITY/DIFFERENCE, NORMAL/EXCEPTIONAL) BUT BY ATTEMPTS TO ELIMINATE THESE BINARIES AND BRING DETAINEES UNDER THE NORMAL RULE OF LAW. THE ATTEMPTS TO BRING THE DETAINEES UNDER THE NORMAL RULE OF LAW ARE SOCIAL FANTASIES, THAT IS DIFFERENT NARRATIVES, WHICH DETERMINE HOW WE UNDERSTAND AND ENGAGE WITH THE LAW IN GUANTANAMO. FANTASIES ARE ALWAYS FRAGMENTED AT THEIR CORE, AND AL-ADAHI CASE WITH THE LACK OF PUBLIC RESPONSE TO IT REVEALS THIS FISSURE IN THE FORM OF THE RETURN OF THE REPRESSED'. IN DOING SO, THE ARTICLE SHOWS HOW THE OVERCOMING OF THE EXCEPTION IS A FANTASY OF MODERN POLITICS AND POINTS TO THE MOMENT THE REPRESSED TRUTH IS REVEALED.
289	THE CREATION OF LEGITIMATE CLAIMS RIGHT CONDITIONS ORIGINATING PROCESSES AND ASSUMPTIONS OF COMMUNICATION, FOR WHICH REASON, WHICH ESTABLISHES AND EXAMINES, TAKES A PROCEDURAL FIGURE IN ITS CONSTITUTION. THUS, A RECONSTRUCTIVE SOCIOLOGY OF DEMOCRACY MUST CHOOSE ITS BASIC CONCEPTS SO THAT THEY IDENTIFY THE PRACTICES POLICIES FRAGMENTS AND PARTICLES OF AN EXISTING RIGHT. THIS PROCEDURE, NAMED IN THIS ARTICLE, DO NOT RESORT TO COVER A PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY, BECAUSE IT IS BASED SOLELY ON THE PREMISE, ACCORDING TO WHICH THE MODE OF OPERATION OF A POLITICAL SYSTEM BASED ON RULE OF LAW, CAN NOT BE ADEQUATELY DESCRIBED OR EVEN AT THE EMPIRICAL LEVEL, NOT WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE EXTENT OF VALIDITY OF THE LAW AND THE LEGITIMIZING POWER OF THE DEMOCRATIC GENESIS OF LAW. THUS, WE ARE TASKED TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EXTERNAL FACTICITY AND VALIDITY RAISED IN THE FIELD OF TENSION BETWEEN THE NORMATIVE SELF-UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW, CLARIFIED THE THEORY OF DISCOURSE, AND THE SOCIAL FACTICITY OF POLITICAL PROCESSES - THAT DEVELOP IN CONSTITUTIONAL FORMS.
290	COULD ANYONE SHAKE NINETEENTH CENTURY RUSSIA OUT OF HER PHILOSOPHICO-JURIDICAL STAGNATION? WAS THERE ANYONE WHO DARED SPEAK OF RIGHTS, OF FREEDOMS BASED ON VITAL PRINCIPLES? WAS THERE ANYONE WHO HAD THE COURAGE TO SUGGEST THAT THE LAW OF FORCE BE TURNED INTO RECOGNITION OF THE FORCE OF LAW, OR WAS BOLD ENOUGH TO CALL FOR THE REVIVAL OF NATURAL LAW ON ITS IDEALIST READING? SOLOV'EV TURNED OUT TO BE THE THINKER WHO WAS ABLE TO DO THESE THINGS. AN AMATEUR IN JURIDICAL QUESTIONS, REMOTE FROM THE ENLIGHTENMENT RATIONALIZATIONS OF POLITICAL LIBERALISM, SOLOV'EV SET OUT TO LAY THE BASIS FOR JURIDICAL FREEDOM IN WAY THAT WAS UNEXPECTED PHILOSOPHICALLY AND CULTURALLY.
291	THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE REASONS FOR A VARIETY IN THE INTERPRETATION OF CONSTITUTIONALISM IN RUSSIAN LEGAL LITERATURE. THE AUTHOR DIVIDES THE VIEWS INTO PRELIMINARY AND CURRENT. THE FORMER RELATE TO THE LACK OF DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONAL TRADITIONS IN THIS COUNTRY AND OF STUDIES ON THE RUSSIAN CONSTITUTIONALISM AT THE TIME OF THE USSR COLLAPSE. THE LATTER GROUP COVERS THE METHODOLOGY OF THE ISSUE: LINGUISTIC AND OF CULTURE AND HISTORY. THE AUTHOR SUGGESTS ONE OF THE MATERIAL REASONS FOR THE LACK OF UNANIMITY ON CONSTITUTIONALISM IS THE POLYSEMY OF THE UNDERLYING CONCEPT OF CONSTITUTION. ON THE OTHER HAND, CONSTITUTIONALISM IS OFTEN IDENTIFIED WITH A PROPER ARCHITECTURE OF STATE POWER AND THE CRITERION FOR PROPRIETY IS UNDERSTOOD IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. THE ARCHITECTURE IMPLYING THAT THE POWER SHOULD FOLLOW A CERTAIN SUPREME LAW (IDEA) SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A WAY OF ITS LEGITIMACY. THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS INCORRECT THE USE OF THE CONCEPT OF CONSTITUTIONALISM TO DEFINE THE MODELS F POWER HAVING EXISTED MANY CENTURIES OR EVEN MILLENNIA BEFORE IT. HOWEVER, THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH CONSTITUTIONALISM CONFIRMS THE POSSIBILITY TO WIDEN ITS STRUCTURE AT THE EXPENSE OF CERTAIN FEUDAL INSTITUTIONS WHICH MODIFIED THE TRAJECTORY AND FORM OF THIS BRANCH. THE PAPER SHOWS FIVE PERIODS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM. ONLY THE FIRST OF THEM (UNTIL 1917) DOES NOT EXCEED THE LIMITS OF EUROPEAN POLITICAL AND LEGAL CULTURE IN TERMS OF SOCIAL AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES WHERE CONSTITUTIONALISM HAS BEEN SHAPED. IN SOVIET RUSSIA ANOTHER CONSTITUTIONALISM WAS BEING FORMED AS IT OPPOSED ALL THE PREVIOUS MODELS. AFTER WW2 (3'D PERIOD)THE INTERNATIONAL BILL OF HUMAN RIGHTS WAS APPROVED WHICH IS IMPLEMENTED IN MANY COUNTRIES, UNIVERSAL AND MUNICIPAL INTERNATIONAL MECHANISMS ARE BEING CREATED. CONSTITUTIONALISM EXCEEDS NATIONAL BORDERS AND ACQUIRES THE FEATURES OF AN INTERNATIONAL STRUCTURE. THE FOURTH PERIOD IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROCLAMATION OF INDEPENDENCE OF THE FORMER COLONIES IN ASIA AND AFRICA. REMAINING OBSOLETE PRE BOURGEOIS RELATIONS IMPEDE THE COMPETENCY OF CONSTITUTIONALISM. THE FIFTH PERIOD STARTED AFTER THE USSR COLLAPSE AND IS CHARACTERIZED WITH THE INCONSISTENCY OF DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES IN THE CONSTITUTIONS AND THE INSTITUTIONS TO SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT OF EMERGING POST-SOVIET STATES.
292	STATE OF EMERGENCY IN FRANCE - HISTORICAL ORIGINS OF THE LEGAL REGIME - WAYS IN WHICH IT WAS ADAPTED AND NORMALISED BETWEEN 2015 AND 2017 - APPLICATION AGAINST RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES AND HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS - INSTITUTIONAL BALANCE BETWEEN POWERS - IN-DEPTH STUDY OF 700 COURT DECISIONS - LEGAL CHALLENGES TO STATE OF EMERGENCY MEASURES - CHALLENGES TO JUDICIAL SCRUTINY
293	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE TOPICAL ISSUES OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE LEGAL REGIME OF MARTIAL LAW IN UKRAINE ON THE JUDICIARY AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN THE COUNTRY. THE ISSUES RELATED TO THE ORGANIZATION OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, THE CONDUCT OF TRIALS AND THE PROVISION OF JUSTICE DURING MARTIAL LAW ARE CONSIDERED. THE CHALLENGES FACED BY COURTS DURING HOSTILITIES ARE ANALYZED, INCLUDING THOSE THAT NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE LIMITATION OF GUARANTEES OF JUSTICE, THE SPEED OF COURT PROCESSINGS, THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, ETC. WITH THE AIM OF FORMING PROMISING WAYS OF IMPROVING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS IN THE CONDITIONS OF MARTIAL LAW, THE EXPERIENCE OF COUNTRIES THAT FACED MARTIAL LAW THROUGHOUT THEIR HISTORY WAS STUDIED. VARIOUS MODELS OF JUDICIARY ARE HIGHLIGHTED, WHICH CAN BE USED TO ENSURE THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL AND THE EFFECTIVE FUNCTIONING OF THE SYSTEM OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WARTIME. ATTENTION IS DRAWN TO THE NEED TO ENSURE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, COMPLIANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICE AND EQUALITY OF ALL BEFORE THE LAW, EVEN UNDER MARTIAL LAW.
294	WITHIN SEGMENTS OF THE OVERLAPPING FIELDS OF POLITICAL ECOLOGY AND POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY, THERE IS AN EMERGING CONSENSUS THAT DIRECT PHYSICAL VIOLENCE IS OVER-STUDIED, AND THAT IT CANNOT BE ANALYTICALLY SEPARATED FROM OTHER FORMS OF VIOLENCE. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THE OPPOSITE, NAMELY, THAT DIRECT PHYSICAL VIOLENCE REMAINS UNDERSTUDIED, AND THAT ANALYZING IT SEPARATELY IS WARRANTED TO GRASP ITS SPECIFICITIES. TO CORROBORATE THIS ARGUMENT, THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE STUDY OF GREEN MILITARIZATION AND GREEN VIOLENCE. WHEREAS A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THIS LITERATURE DISCUSSES DIRECT PHYSICAL VIOLENCE, MOST STUDIES FOCUS ON BROADER CONDITIONS AND DISCOURSES OF VIOLENCE, WITHOUT EMPIRICALLY DEMONSTRATING HOW THEY FEED INTO THE PRODUCTION OF DIRECT PHYSICAL VIOLENCE. CONSEQUENTLY, THESE STUDIES DO NOT ACCURATELY MAP THE ENTIRE "KILL CHAIN". A CASE STUDY OF VIOLENCE IN VIRUNGA NATIONAL PARK, IN EASTERN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, DEMONSTRATES THE ANALYTICAL MERITS OF STUDYING DIRECT PHYSICAL VIOLENCE THROUGH A "MICRODYNAMICS" APPROACH, IMPLYING THE DETAILED STUDY OF SPECIFIC ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND HOW THEY WERE COMMITTED. FAR FROM DISTRACTING FROM BROADER CONDITIONS, STRUCTURES AND HISTORIES OF VIOLENCE, A MICRODYNAMICS APPROACH PROVIDES AN ENTRY POINT FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW THESE DIMENSIONS FEED INTO THE PRODUCTION OF DIRECT PHYSICAL VIOLENCE, AND HOW THIS VIOLENCE INTERACTS WITH OTHER FORMS OF VIOLENCE. IN ADDITION, IT ALLOWS FOR A MORE ACCURATE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE KILL CHAIN IS CONSTITUTED IN TIME AND SPACE. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT ACKNOWLEDGING THE PARTICULARITIES OF DIFFERENT MODALITIES OF VIOLENCE, INSTEAD OF CONFLATING THEM, WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCE THE STUDY OF GEOGRAPHIES OF VIOLENCE.
295	IN THE WAKE OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, LEADING STATESMEN ANXIOUSLY SOUGHT TO ASSOCIATE THE UNITED STATES WITH THE "CIVILIZED NATIONS" OF EUROPE. A CIVILIZED NATION REPLACED PRIVATE REVENGE WITH THE RULE OF LAW-INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL LAW. DURING THE 1810S AND 1820S, HOWEVER, SUCH EFFORTS PROVOKED A POPULAR REACTION LED AND EMBODIED BY ANDREW JACKSON, "THE PEOPLE'S AVENGER."
296	EVERY HUMAN LIFE TAKES PLACE IN CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER PEOPLE, THAT IS IN PUBLIC RELATIONS. EVEN IN CASES WHERE A PERSON STANDS IN NO RELATION TO ANOTHER PARTICULAR PERSON, BUT WITH A PARTICULAR AUTHORITY OR AN ORGANIZED COMMUNITY OF CITIZENS, A PUBLIC ORGANIZATION, S/HE ULTIMATELY COMES IN A CERTAIN RELATIONSHIP WITH ANOTHER PERSON. DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF SOCIAL RELATIONS ARE COMMONNESS AND REPEATABILITY. IT IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED THAT THE PART OF THE SPECTRUM OF SOCIAL RELATIONS REGULATED BY THE LAW IS CALLED LEGAL RELATIONS. THE LAW CANNOT REGULATE ALL RELATIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE IN THE LITERAL SENSE. INTERPERSONAL RELATIONS IN EVERYDAY LIFE, NEIGHBOR RELATIONS, FRIENDSHIP, INTIMATE RELATIONS BETWEEN A HUSBAND AND A WIFE: THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE LIST OF RELATIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT GOVERNED BY THE LAW, BUT AT THE SAME TIME PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN EVERYONE'S LIFE. EVERY PERSON SINCE HIS/HER BIRTH ENTERS THE SYSTEM OF ALREADY ESTABLISHED AND SETTLED LEGAL RELATIONS. IN ANY CASE, ANY LEGAL RELATIONS ARE THE RESULT OF CONSCIOUS HUMAN ACTIVITY. AT THE HEART OF EVERY RELATIONSHIP IS A CONSCIOUS ACTIVITY OF PEOPLE. THIS IS THE FIRST POINT THE AUTHOR FOCUSES HIS ATTENTION ON. PUBLIC RELATIONS BECOMING LEGAL ONES ACQUIRE A NUMBER OF NEW PROPERTIES. SINCE LEGAL RELATIONS ARE THOSE ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE, THEY ARE NOT ONLY THE CONTENT OF CERTAIN LEGAL NORMS, BUT THEY ALSO RECEIVE A MANDATORY PROPERTY OF THEIR EXECUTION. THE GOVERNMENT INITIALLY LAYS A POSSIBILITY OF LEGAL ENFORCEMENT IN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RESULTING LEGAL RELATIONS, BECAUSE IT IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT THE RULE OF LAW WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF ITS FORCED EXECUTION IS ACTUALLY NO LONGER THE RULE OF LAW: IT IS A WELL-INTENTIONED WISH, RECOMMENDATION, ADVICE, BUT NOT THE RULE OF LAW. ANOTHER FEATURE OF LEGAL RELATIONS IS THAT BY REGULATING RELATIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE THEY GENERALLY GOVERN RELATIONS THAT ARE SOCIALLY DESIRABLE AND APPROVED. AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, SOCIALLY CENSURED ACTIONS, ACTIONS THAT VIOLATE THE REQUIREMENTS OF LEGAL NORMS: OFFENSES AND, IN THEIR EXTREME FORM, CRIMES, ARE NOT EXCLUDED. STILL, LAW-ABIDING AND INFRINGING BEHAVIOR IS A RESULT OF THE BEHAVIOR OF SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS, THEIR INTENTIONAL MOTIVATED BEHAVIOR. THUS, ANY BEHAVIORAL ACT REGULATED BY A LEGAL NORM SHOULD DISTINGUISH ACTIONS THEMSELVES AND THEIR RESULTS: THE IMPACT OF ACTIONS AND THE PERSONALITY OF THE SUBJECT WHO COMMITTED THESE ACTIONS. INDEED, ALL ACTIONS ARE COMMITTED BY A PERSON. THIS IS THE SECOND POINT THE AUTHOR FOCUSES HIS ATTENTION ON.
297	DO PANDEMICS HAVE LASTING CONSEQUENCES FOR POLITICAL BEHAVIOR? THE AUTHORS ADDRESS THIS QUESTION BY EXAMINING THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE DEADLIEST PANDEMIC OF THE LAST MILLENNIUM: THE BLACK DEATH (1347-1351). THEY CLAIM THAT PANDEMICS CAN INFLUENCE POLITICS IN THE LONG RUN IF THE LOSS OF LIFE IS HIGH ENOUGH TO INCREASE THE PRICE OF LABOR RELATIVE TO OTHER FACTORS OF PRODUCTION. WHEN THIS OCCURS, LABOR-REPRESSIVE REGIMES, SUCH AS SERFDOM, BECOME UNTENABLE, WHICH ULTIMATELY LEADS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROTO-DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND ASSOCIATED POLITICAL CULTURES THAT SHAPE MODALITIES OF POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT FOR GENERATIONS. THE AUTHORS TEST THEIR THEORY BY TRACING THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE BLACK DEATH IN GERMAN-SPEAKING CENTRAL EUROPE. THEY FIND THAT AREAS HIT HARDEST BY THAT PANDEMIC WERE MORE LIKELY TO ADOPT INCLUSIVE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS AND EQUITABLE LAND OWNERSHIP PATTERNS, TO EXHIBIT ELECTORAL BEHAVIOR INDICATING INDEPENDENCE FROM LANDED ELITE INFLUENCE DURING THE TRANSITION TO MASS POLITICS, AND TO HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER VOTE SHARES FOR HITLER'S NATIONAL SOCIALIST PARTY IN THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC'S FATEFUL 1930 AND JULY 1932 ELECTIONS.
298	LEGAL CERTAINTY IS THE PRINCIPLE THAT ENSURES THE REALIZATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF RULE OF LAW, PRIMARILY IN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AS WELL AS IN ALL OTHER FIELDS OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE WILL ATTEMPT TO ANALYZE THE PLACE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY IN EU ADMINISTRATIVE LAW WITH REGARD TO DECISIONS OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE.
299	EVIDENCES HAVE A GREAT SIGNIFICANCE IN CRIMINAL PROCEDURAL LAW TO FIND OUT MATERIAL TRUTHS. HOWEVER, THERE MUST BE SOME RESTRICTIONS ON OBTAINING AND ASSESSING EVIDENCES IN A CRIMINAL PROCEDURE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO SHOW THE LEGISLATIVE OUTLOOK OF THE CURRENT LEGISLATION REGARDING UNLAWFULLY OBTAINED EVIDENCES IN TURKISH CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW.
300	THE PAPER DISCUSSES PERCEPTIONS AND REPRESENTATIONS OF THE AGRARIAN ELITES ON - AND, MORE OFTEN AGAINST - THE INDIANS AND PEASANTS. THE EXAMINATION OF DISCURSIVE PRACTICES COMMON TO SO-CALLED AGRARIANS, AS STIGMA, DENIAL AND SUPPRESSION OF OTHERNESS, SUGGESTS A CONSERVATIVE OUTLOOK AND EXCLUSIONARY NATION, AN INSTRUMENTAL VIEW OF DEMOCRACY AND AN AMBIGUOUS ATTITUDE TOWARD HIS OWN RULE OF LAW.
301	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE LEGAL REGIME OF THE PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF A MAN AND A CITIZEN, OF THE RULE OF LAW AND OF PUBLIC SAFETY. AUTHOR ALSO DESCRIBES THE LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT IN THE FORMS DEFINED BY LAW INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS, THEREBY REFLECTING DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE MECHANISM OF LEGAL REGULATION.
302	PRESIDENT VIKTOR YANUKOVYCH HAS LED UKRAINE, NO STRANGER TO CRISIS, INTO YET ANOTHER ROUND OF TURMOIL. HE HAS ROLLED BACK DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW WHILE FAILING TO TAKE ON CORRUPTION OR BRING THE COUNTRY CLOSER TO EUROPE. NOW, MUCH OF THE PUBLIC HAS TURNED AGAINST HIM-AND THE NATION COULD BE HEADED FOR STILL MORE SERIOUS UNREST.
303	JOSEPH A. SEMUGABI, CHIEF LIBRARIAN AT THE LAW DEVELOPMENT CENTRE, DISCUSSES POLITICAL-LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS SINCE 1986 WHICH RESULTED IN THE RESTORATION OF RULE OF LAW AND THE LIBERALIZATION OF UNIVERSITY EDUCATION IN UGANDA. HE THEN EXPLAINS HOW THESE HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COUNTRY'S ONLY INSTITUTION OF PRACTICAL LEGAL TRAINING AND ITS LAW LIBRARY.
304	WITH THE EXCEPTION OF KANT, VOLTAIRE, OR MARX, IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND IN CONTEMPORARY HISTORY A THINKER WITH A GREATER PRESENCE IN DEBATES ON THE RULE OF LAW THAN HERMANN HELLER, WHOSE IDEAS HAVE INFLUENCED BOTH THE THINKING AND THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF SPANISH DEMOCRACY. IN THESE PAGES, AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO APPROXIMATE THE REASON OF SUCH PRESENCE.
305	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS PANEL DATA ESTIMATES OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDICATORS OF GOVERNANCE AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) USING A SAMPLE OF COUNTRIES FROM ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA. WHILE CONTROLLING FOR STANDARD FDI VARIABLES, THE RESULTS PROVIDE STRONG CONFIRMATION THAT THE RULE OF LAW; CONTROL OF CORRUPTION; REGULATORY QUALITY; GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND POLITICAL STABILITY ARE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH FDI.
306	THE MAHARASHTRA GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO WITHDRAW A LARGE NUMBER OF CRIMINAL CASES, INCLUDING SOME 200 MURDER CASES REGISTERED IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMUNAL RIOTS IN MUMBAI IN 1992-93, IS PATENTLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL. WHEN THE GOVERNMENT USURPS THE STATUTORY POWERS OF THE POLICE, AS THE MAHARASHTRA GOVERNMENT HAS DONE, THAT MARKS THE END OF THE RULE OF LAW.
307	DESPITE UBIQUITOUS CALLS FOR THEIR REFORM, INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS (IOS) OFTEN SUFFER FROM LEGITIMACY DEFICITS. WHAT EXPLAINS THE EMERGENCE OF LEGITIMACY DEFICITS AND WHAT EFFECTS DO THEY PRODUCE? THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE GRADUAL EMERGENCE OF LEGITIMACY DEFICITS THROUGH THE CONCEPT OF LEGITIMACY DRIFT. LEGITIMACY DRIFT OCCURS WHEN AN ORGANIZATION LOSES LEGITIMACY BY FAILING TO ADAPT ITSELF TO A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. IT IDENTIFIES THREE SOURCES OF LEGITIMACY DRIFT: FAILURE TO LIVE UP TO PRE-EXISTING STANDARDS (BROKEN PROMISES), CHANGES IN THE STANDARDS OF LEGITIMACY BY WHICH ORGANIZATIONS ARE ASSESSED (SHIFTING STANDARDS), AND CHANGES IN AN ORGANIZATION'S RELEVANT PUBLIC (AUDIENCE SHIFT). LEGITIMACY DEFICITS TYPICALLY PROMPT ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSES. THESE INCLUDE ATTEMPTS AT RE-LEGITIMATION THROUGH INSTITUTIONAL REFORM AND OPERATIONAL ADAPTATION, BUT ALSO OTHER COPING MECHANISMS' SUCH AS PROMISES OF REFORM, THE LOGIC OF CONFIDENCE, AND DECOUPLING. COPING MECHANISMS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT WHERE REFORM IS BLOCKED. THIS MODEL IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL, ONE OF THE OLDEST AND MOST POWERFUL IOS. A CONCLUSION CALLS FOR BRIDGING HISTORICAL AND SOCIOLOGICAL INSTITUTIONALISM TO BETTER UNDERSTAND IO LEGITIMACY IN TIME.
308	THIS PAPER ADDRESSES A COMPLEX PROBLEM OF FINDING OPTIMAL OR SUBOPTIMAL STRATEGIES AND BUSINESS DECISIONS OF (1) ENTREPRENEURS, INVENTORS, INNOVATORS, AND OTHER "ECONOMIC ACTORS" WHO ARE ENGAGED, OR WANT AND CAN BE ENGAGED, IN INNOVATION ACTIVITIES, AND (2) POLICYMAKERS WHO WANT TO SECURE BOTH STABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL OR REGIONAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEM. IN CONTRAST TO MANY PAPERS WHICH SEPARATELY DISCUSS INNOVATION BEHAVIOR AND INNOVATION POLICIES, OUR RESEARCH AIMS TO FILL SUCH A GAP AND SHOW HOW THESE ASPECTS ARE INTEGRATED. THE AUTHORS SUGGEST AND PRESENT BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE APPROACHES USING GAME-THEORETIC ANALYSIS AND LIVING LAB SIMULATION WHAT TRIGGERS, CATALYSTS AND ACCELERATORS FOR ENTREPRENEURIAL AND INNOVATIVE ACTION AND RESULTS CAN BE BETTER SUPPORTED BY POLICY AND PRACTICE.
309	THEORY ON LEGAL TRANSPLANTS MAKES A DISTINCTION BETWEEN RECEPTION IN LAW AND RECEPTION IN SOCIETY. BOTH TOPICS GENERATE THEIR OWN DEBATES: THE FORMER ARE CONCERNED WITH THE QUESTION HOW THE DEEPER LYING LEGAL EPISTEMOLOGICAL STRUCTURES SHAPE THE WAY IN WHICH TRANSPLANTED RULES AND INSTITUTIONS ACQUIRE NEW MEANING, THE LATTER WITH HOW SUCH RULES WORK OUT ON THE SOCIAL PROCESSES THEY OUGHT TO REGULATE. USUALLY THE CASES CHOSEN FOR LOOKING AT THE LEGAL SIDE ARE FROM WELL-DEVELOPED LEGAL SYSTEMS, WHEREAS THOSE ABOUT DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FOCUS ON THE SOCIAL EFFECTIVENESS. THIS IGNORES THAT MANY SUCH SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD - INCLUDING IN ASIA - ARE FRAGMENTED, UNEVENLY DEVELOPED, AND UNLIKELY TO BE CAPABLE OF EFFECTIVELY APPROPRIATING AND RECONSTRUCTING NEW RULES. THE PRESENT ARTICLE TAKES INDONESIA AS AN EXAMPLE TO SHOW HOW STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS OF LEGAL SYSTEMS IN COUNTRIES ADOPTING LEGAL TRANSPLANTS MAY PREVENT LEGAL RULES AND INSTITUTIONS FROM BEING ACCOMMODATED INTO THEM. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THIS RESISTANCE CAN BE EXPLAINED ONLY IN PART FROM FACTORS SUCH AS GOVERNMENTAL FRAGMENTATION, CORRUPTION, MALFUNCTIONING OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM, OR A LEGAL PLURAL COLONIAL HERITAGE, AND THAT THEY ARE INHERENT IN THE STATE OF LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP AND JURISPRUDENCE. IN INDONESIA THESE ARE INCAPABLE OF PRODUCING THE COHERENT LEGAL THEORIES REQUIRED FOR EFFECTIVE RECEPTION OF FOREIGN LAW AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS, A SITUATION LIKELY TO BE FOUND IN MANY COUNTRIES. GIVEN THE STRUCTURAL FACTORS UNDERPINNING THIS STATE OF LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP AND JURISPRUDENCE, CHANGE WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO EFFECT AND THE RULE OF LAW IS AN IDEAL THAT REMAINS FAR AWAY.
310	WHEN TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE GATHERED ON DAM SQUARE ON THE DAY OF [THEO] VAN GOGH'S MURDER TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR ANGER, ABOUTALEB WAS ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF MUSLIMS. THIS WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT TO HIM. "EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT HAVE FOUND VAN GOGH AN ASSHOLE," HE SAYS, "THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE TO DEFEND THE RULE OF LAW."(1)
311	THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC GAVE RISE TO A KIND OF LEGISLATION THAT, WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO URGENT NEEDS AND OTHER CAUSES, HAS SHOWN ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THAT IT PRESENTS RELEVANT LEGAL TECHNICAL PROBLEMS AND EXCESSIVE IDEOLOGICAL CONTENT. IT IS DESIRABLE THAT THESE LEGAL OBSERVATIONS DO NOT OCCUR AGAIN, PROVIDING THE ENTIRE LEGAL SYSTEM WITH GREATER LEGAL CERTAINTY, BASIS OF THE RULE OF LAW.
312	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE APPLICATION OF THE CATEGORY OF IMPRESCRIPTIBLE VOIDNESS [I.E. "JURIDICAL INEXISTENCE"] TO JUDICIAL DECISIONS. IT HAS EXPERIENCED HISTORICAL CONTINUITY SINCE ROMAN LAW TO OUR DAYS, AS WELL AS A SMALL BUT IMPORTANT PRESENCE IN CONTINENTAL COMPARATIVE LAW; THEREFORE, IT SHOULD BE MORE CLEARLY RECEIVED IN CHILEAN LAW AS A MECHANISM OF PROTECTION OF THE RULE OF LAW.
313	THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO DETERMINE THE MOST ADEQUATE INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES TO INTRODUCE INTO A GROWTH MODEL, DEPENDING ON THE INCOME LEVELS OF COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT, FOR RICH COUNTRIES, THE RULE OF LAW IS FUNDAMENTAL WHILE, FOR POOR COUNTRIES, IT IS CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. THIS HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR ANY AGENDA OF INSTITUTIONAL REFORM IN EITHER TYPE OF COUNTRY.
314	CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN - CONSTITUTIONAL DEGRADATION - POWER SHARING - THE RULE OF LAW - CONSTITUTIONALISM - CONSTITUTION MAKING - CONSTITUTIONAL TRANSITION - DIVIDED SOCIETIES - ROLE OF INTERNAL DIVERSITY - BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA - INHERENT DEGRADATION - DYNAMIC DEGRADATION - EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS - SEJDI AND FINCI - CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA - COMPLIANCE ISSUES WITH COURT JUDGMENTS - REPRESSION OF THE PUBLIC SPHERE - ELECTORAL DISCRIMINATION OF NATIONAL MINORITIES - HIGH REPRESENTATIVE - LACK OF LOCAL OWNERSHIP
315	THIS ARTICLE FACES A SENSITIVE ISSUE: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION AND VULNERABILITY. AFTER A SHORT LEGAL-HISTORICAL OVERVIEW, CLOSE ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO TWO OPPOSITE PHENOMENA CONCERNING CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION, WITH SPECIFIC ITALIAN AND FRENCH CASE STUDIES. MOREOVER, CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION IS SCRUTINIZED FROM A LEGAL-THEORETICAL VIEWPOINT AS A POSITIVE RIGHT, WHOSE LIMITS DESERVE CAREFUL CONSIDERATION WITHIN THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW.
316	THE SPANISH INSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM HAS WORRYING WEAKNESSES. ALTHOUGH THE ROOTS ARE OLDER, THE DETERIORATION HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE SINCE 2015. IN THIS WORK, DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ARA ANALYZED AS A REFLECTION OF THIS SITUATION. EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES AS THE CRISIS IN CATALONIA OR THE HEALTH CRISIS HAVE AGGRAVATED THIS SITUATION. THE CONCLUSION IS A SIGNIFICANT WEAKNESS OF THE RULE OF LAW.
317	AT PRESENT, THE CONCEPT OF GOOD OCEAN GOVERNANCE IS ARTICULATED IN THE LITERATURE ONLY. THIS PAPER ADOPTED EIGHT ELEMENTS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AS AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK, NAMELY, THE RULE OF LAW, PARTICIPATORY, TRANSPARENCY, CONSENSUS-BASED DECISION MAKING, ACCOUNTABILITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSIVENESS, RESPONSIVENESS AND COHERENCE. THESE ELEMENTS ARE PARTIALLY SUPPORTED BY INTERNATIONAL TREATY PRACTICE BUT HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED UNIVERSAL ACCEPTANCE.
318	THIS PAPER REVIEWS CERTAIN DECISIONS ADOPTED RECENTLY BY THE SPANISH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT (STC 136/2011, ATC 7/2012 AND ATC 9/2012), WHICH REVEAL A CERTAIN DISREGARD FOR RULE OF LAW IN LEGISLATIVE PROCEEDINGS. THIS AFFECTS PARLIAMENT'S MINORITIES INSOFAR AS IT PREVENTS OR HINDERS THEIR LEGISLATIVE PARTICIPATION AND THEIR ACCESS TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, BOTH KEY ELEMENTS IN ANY DEMOCRATIC
319	"SUPERPRESIDENTIALISM, AMBIGUOUS FEDERALISM, THE WEAKNESS OF POLITICAL PARTIES AND LABOR AND CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS, THE INORDINATE STRENGTH OF BIG BUSINESS, AND THE VIRTUAL ABSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW REPRESENT MAJOR BLEMISHES ON RUSSIA'S NASCENT DEMOCRACY...[BUT] IN BEMOANING RUSSIA'S SLOW START IN CONSOLIDATING A LIBERAL DEMOCRACY, WE MUST NOT FORGET THE IMPORTANT PROGRESS MADE IN ESTABLISHING AN ELECTORAL DEMOCRACY IN RUSSIA."
320	SINCE THE RISE OF THE ARAB SPRING, A SERIES OF SOCIAL MOVEMENTS HAVE LED TO A DETERIORATION OF POLITICAL STABILITY IN SOME ARAB COUNTRIES. IN THE PAST DECADE, ORDINARY PEOPLE IN ARAB COUNTRIES HAVE GENERALLY INCREASED THEIR ASPIRATIONS TO EXPRESS THEIR OWN POLITICAL OPINIONS IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE. WHEN VIEWED FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL REFORMS, THE DEGREES OF POLITICAL PARTICIPATION OF DIFFERENT NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS ARE EVENTUALLY INFLUENCED BY THE TRANSITION FROM AUTHORITARIAN RULE AND ARE CHARACTERISED BY THEIR POLITY. WHILE BEFORE THE ARAB SPRING, THE PERFORMANCE OF RELIGIOUS AFFILIATED POLITICAL PARTIES IN EVERY NATION'S PARLIAMENT WAS NOT PROMINENT, BUT THE DEMOCRATISATION REFORM PROVIDED THESE RELIGIOUS AFFILIATED POLITICAL PARTIES WITH IMPORTANT POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES TO EVEN OVERTAKE THEIR SECULAR OPPONENTS. RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS ARE DOMINANT CULTURAL IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA (MENA). THE POLITICAL PARTICIPATION OF RELIGIOUS AFFILIATED POLITICAL PARTIES PLAYS A DIRECTIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE ROLE ON THE CURRENT DEVELOPMENT OF POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS RELATIONS IN THIS ERA. BY COMPARING THE POLITICAL PERFORMANCE OF ISLAMIC POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN ARAB COUNTRIES SINCE 2010, THIS ESSAY ATTEMPTS TO THEORETICALLY EXPLORE THE ROLE OF RELIGIOUS AFFILIATED POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE PROCESS OF SOCIAL INTEGRATION AND THE POLITICAL MODERNISATION AFTER THE DEMOCRATISATION REVOLUTION, AND EXPLAINS THE INTERVENTION OF DEEPLY-ROOTED RELIGIOUS TRADITION INTO PUBLIC POLITICS. RELIGIOUS AFFILIATED POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE ARAB COUNTRIES ARE STRENGTHENED ON THE ONE HAND BY INTERNAL INITIATIVE AND ON THE OTHER HAND BY CATERING TO EXTERNAL NEEDS. HOWEVER, AT THE SAME TIME, THE POLITICAL PARTICIPATION OF RELIGIOUS AFFILIATED POLITICAL PARTIES HAS TRIGGERED CONCERNS AMONGST SECULARISTS ABOUT THEOCRACY, AND ITS TRUE EFFECTIVENESS IS ALSO SEVERELY CONSTRAINED BY THE DEGREE OF PROGRESS IN THE POLITICAL MODERNISATION PROCESS OF THE HOST COUNTRY.
321	AN INCREASING NUMBER OF ACADEMICS, IN AND OUTSIDE CHINA, HAVE EXPRESSED UNPRECEDENTED PESSIMISM OR DISMISSIVENESS REGARDING CHINA'S LEGAL REFORMS UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF XI JINPING, ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO THE FUTURE DIRECTION OF THE REFORMS. THESE ARE SUCH, DESPITE THE CONTINUING, EXTENSIVE LEGAL REFORMS WHICH WERE LAUNCHED IN 2013/2014 AND CONTINUE TILL TODAY. THIS ARTICLE TAKES A CONTEXTUAL APPROACH TO EXAMINING SEVERAL ASPECTS OF LEGAL DEVELOPMENT THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A RULE OF LAW IN CHINA. IT ANALYSES THE VARIOUS EMERGING TRENDS IN XI'S "NEW ERA" THAT SEEM TO HAVE SET OFF ALARMS OF RETREAT FROM POLITICO-LEGAL REFORMS THAT WERE INITIALLY LAUNCHED IN 1978. THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT, IF XI'S CHINA IS ENTERING A "NEW ERA", THIS NEW ERA, AS FAR AS LEGAL REFORMS ARE CONCERNED, IS LIKELY TO BE ONE REGRESSING FROM, RATHER THAN PROGRESSING TOWARDS, ESTABLISHING A GENUINE RULE OF LAW. WHILE THE PACE AND PATH WILL BE UNCERTAIN AND DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, MANY OF THE POLITICO-LEGAL REFORMS INITIATED BY DENG XIAOPING, DEVELOPED BY HIS SUCCESSORS, AND THEORISED BY NO LESS THAN THREE GENERATIONS OF LEGAL SCHOLARS HAVE ENDED.
322	CONVENTIONAL WISDOM TELLS US THAT, AFTER THE UNITED STATES WAS FOUNDED, WE REPLACED OUR SYSTEM OF COMMON LAW CRIMES WITH CRIMINAL STATUTES AND THAT THIS SHIFT FROM COMMON LAW TO CODIFICATION VINDICATED IMPORTANT RULE-OF-LAW VALUES. BUT THIS ORIGIN STORY IS FALSE ON BOTH COUNTS. THE COMMON LAW CONTINUES TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MODERN AMERICAN CRIMINAL LAW, AND TO THE EXTENT THAT IT HAS BEEN DISPLACED BY STATUTES, OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS NOT IMPROVED. CRIMINAL STATUTES REGULARLY DELEGATE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SCOPE OF CRIMINAL LAW TO PROSECUTORS, AND JUDGES HAVE FAILED TO SERVE AS A CHECK ON THAT POWER. AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE CURRENT SYSTEM PROVIDES LESS NOTICE, LESS ACCOUNTABILITY, LESS SEPARATION OF POWERS, AND MORE POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE THAN THE COMMON LAW SYSTEM. THUS, TO THE EXTENT THE STATUTE HAS DISPLACED COMMON LAW, THE SHIFT IS NOT A STORY OF THE TRIUMPH OF THE RULE OF LAW; IT IS INSTEAD A STORY OF LEGISLATIVE EXCESS, PROSECUTORIAL SUPREMACY, AND JUDICIAL ABDICATION. THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM OF CRIMINAL COMMON LAW IS NOT ONLY FALSE, BUT IT ALSO CONCEALS THE FAILINGS OF OUR CURRENT CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.
323	THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CANDIDATE, PRESIDENT-ELECT, AND NOW PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP INDICATE THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION WILL AGGRESSIVELY SEEK TO USE STATE POWER WITH LITTLE REGARD FOR THE RULE OF LAW. A GREAT DEAL HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REGULATING INTER AND INTRA BRANCH SEPARATION OF POWERS. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL AND THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF GOVERNMENT LAWYERS AS LAWYERS. THIS ARTICLE ENGAGES WITH NUMEROUS CONTESTED ISSUES IN THE LAW OF LAWYERING, THE HISTORY OF UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR BY GOVERNMENT ATTORNEYS, AND JURISPRUDENCE TO PROVIDE A CONSTRUCTIVE LEGAL AND ETHICAL CONCEPTION OF GOVERNMENT LEGAL ADVISORS. IN PRACTICAL TERMS, IT MAY SERVE AS A SOURCE OF GUIDANCE FOR LAWYERS IN THE NEW ADMINISTRATION, OR AS A ROADMAP FOR DISCIPLINE BY LAWYER REGULATORS. MORE THEORETICALLY, IT DEFENDS A CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A PRACTICE OF REASON-GIVING, NOT DEPENDENT UPON LEGAL OBJECTIVITY OR DETERMINACY. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER BANNING TRAVEL TO THE UNITED STATES FROM SEVERAL MUSLIM-MAJORITY COUNTRIES, AND THE SUBSEQUENT FIRING OF ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL SALLY YATES, ARE CASE STUDIES ILLUSTRATING THE ETHICAL ANALYSIS IN THIS ARTICLE.
324	IN THIS ARTICLE I EXAMINE PUBLIC EVALUATIONS OF QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE IN EAST ASIA AND ANALYZE THE EFFECTS OF PERCEIVED GOVERNANCE QUALITY ON REGIME SUPPORT. I DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TWO MODES OF GOVERNANCE, DEMOCRATIC AND LAW-BASED, AND EXAMINE WHICH MODE OF GOVERNANCE MATTERS. IT WAS FOUND THAT EAST ASIAN DEMOCRACIES SUFFERED VARIOUS GOVERNANCE DEFICITS IN THE EYES OF THEIR PUBLICS. IT WAS ALSO REVEALED THAT A WEAK RULE OF LAW REMAINED THE MOST NOTABLE GOVERNANCE MALAISE ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION. THE MICRO-LEVEL ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT PERCEIVED QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE SHAPED REGIME ALLEGIANCE AND INSTITUTIONAL CONFIDENCE BUT NOT ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNANCE MATTERED. IT WAS SHOWN THAT LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE SERVED AS THE MAJOR SOURCE OF REGIME SUPPORT REGARDLESS OF REGIME TYPES. ON THE WHOLE, PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE PREVAILING SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION DEPENDED ON QUALITY OF LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE AS WELL AS NATIONAL ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. YET, EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE ENCOURAGES CITIZEN SKEPTICISM OF THE ONGOING POLITICAL ORDER, SUPPORTING THE THESIS OF ASSERTIVE CITIZENSHIP. OVERALL, THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ESTABLISHING A STRONG RULE OF LAW CONSTITUTES ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES TO REGIME CONSOLIDATION ACROSS MUCH OF EAST ASIA.
325	AS A RESULT OF THE STEEP INCREASE IN INVESTMENT ARBITRATIONS, AND THE PROBLEMS THIS HAS BROUGHT TO THE FORE, MANY REFORM EFFORTS IN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW FOCUS ON CHANGES TO INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT (ISDS). REFORM PROPOSALS, HOWEVER, DIVERGE WIDELY (RANGING FROM EXITING THE SYSTEM COMPLETELY TO INSTITUTIONALIZING IT FURTHER THROUGH THE CREATION OF AN APPELLATE MECHANISM OR A PERMANENT INVESTMENT COURT) AND DO NOT PROCEED ON THE BASIS OF A NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK THAT IS GLOBALLY CONSENTED. THIS RISKS ACHIEVING NEEDED SYSTEMIC REFORM. THE PRESENT ARTICLE SETS OUT THE CONTOURS OF SUCH A NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK. IT SUGGESTS THAT THE CRITICISM OF ISDS HAS ITS ORIGINS IN FRICTIONS WITH CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES, NAMELY DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND HUMAN RIGHTS. REFORM PROPOSALS, AS A CONSEQUENCE, SHOULD BE DEVELOPED BY REFERENCE TO PRINCIPLES OF (COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL) CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. SUCH A FRAMEWORK CAN BE USED TO FORMULATE A NUMBER OF CONCRETE PROPOSALS FOR ISDS REFORM, IN PARTICULAR INCREASED INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF ISDS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OTHER MECHANISMS THAT ALLOW STATES TO ENSURE THAT ISDS DEVELOPS IN LINE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRACY AND RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS.
326	THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS VITAL TO BUILDING AND SUSTAINING PEACE. THESE EFFORTS ARE OFTEN RECOGNIZED AS BUSINESS FOR PEACE OR PEACE THROUGH COMMERCE. ACADEMIC RESEARCH ON BUSINESS FOR PEACE IS ALMOST TWENTY YEARS OLD AND TENDS TO BE THEORETICAL. THIS PAPER IS THE FIRST TO PRESENT QUALITATIVE FINDINGS ON BUSINESSES OPERATING IN AN ACTIVE VIOLENT CONFLICT SUCH AS THE CASE OF IRAQ. COMPANIES IN IRAQ OPERATE UNDER THE CONSTANT THREAT OF VIOLENCE AND YET MANY STILL TRY TO ENHANCE PEACE THROUGH OPERATIONS. WE INTERVIEWED MORE THAN 40 PARTICIPANTS WHO WERE BUSINESS OWNERS, MANAGERS, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND INTERNATIONAL POLICYMAKERS WHO WERE ACTIVE IN THE IRAQI THEATER. WE DISCUSS OUR FINDINGS THAT RELATE TO THE PERCEPTION OF COMPANY ACTIVITIES AS PEACE ENHANCING INTO FOUR CATEGORIES: CAPACITY BUILDING, RULE OF LAW, SOCIAL COHESION, AND LOCAL ENGAGEMENT. OUR FINDINGS SUPPORT THE EXISTING BUSINESS AND PEACE CATEGORIES OF RULE OF LAW AND SOCIAL COHESION. OUR FINDINGS ALSO SUGGEST THAT CURRENT THEORY MAY BE MISSING CAPACITY BUILDING AND LOCAL ENGAGEMENT AS IMPORTANT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE PEACE. WE CONCLUDE BY NOTING THE LIMITATIONS OF THE PAPER AND THE NEED FOR MORE QUALITATIVE RESEARCH.
327	THE CROSS-COUNTRY RESULTS PRESENTED HERE SHOW THAT MOST ASPECTS OF GOVERNANCE AFFECT TRANSITION AND NON-TRANSITION ECONOMIES DIFFERENTLY. FOR GOVERNMENTS IN TRANSITION, MORE REGULATION, GREATER VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, HEIGHTENED GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND STRONGER RULE OF LAW SURPRISINGLY MATTER VERY LITTLE. WHAT MATTERS MOST FOR THESE TRANSITION ECONOMIES IS POLITICAL STABILITY AND INSULATING THE COUNTRY'S BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT FROM CORRUPTION.
328	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND CATCH-UP OF KOREA OVER THE PAST HALF CENTURY. KOREA'S GROWTH EXPERIENCE CONFIRMS THE PREDICTION OF A CONDITIONAL CONVERGENCE THEORY. CROSS-COUNTRY REGRESSION FURTHER SUGGESTS THAT KOREA'S STRONG CATCH-UP TO THE USA IS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO ITS FAVORABLE GROWTH FACTORS SUCH AS STRONG INVESTMENT, LOWER FERTILITY, GREATER TRADE OPENNESS, AND IMPROVEMENTS IN HUMAN RESOURCES AND RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, AS KOREA CATCHES UP TO THE USA AND ITS STEADY-STATE LEVEL IN PER WORKER OUTPUT, IT WILL BE SUBJECT TO A GROWTH SLOWDOWN UNLESS IMPROVEMENTS ARE MADE IN THOSE GROWTH FACTORS. WHILE MANUFACTURING-ORIENTED AND EXPORT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT HAS SERVED KOREA'S SUCCESS WELL, POOR PRODUCTIVITY PERFORMANCE IN THE SERVICES SECTOR HAS HAMPERED OVERALL PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH. KOREA'S EXPERIENCE IMPLIES THAT CHINA'S POTENTIAL GROWTH RATES ARE LIKELY TO SLOW IN THE COMING DECADES DUE TO THE CONVERGENCE EFFECT AND WITH THE REBALANCING TOWARD A DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION AND SERVICES-BASED ECONOMY. CHINA NEEDS TO UPGRADE ITS RULE OF LAW, REFORM STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES AND IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY, PARTICULARLY IN ITS SERVICES SECTOR, TO SUSTAIN STRONG GROWTH.
329	THIS PAPER SEEKS TO PROBLEMATIZE THE CONCEPTUAL AND POLITICAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WHAT ARE CONSIDERED DIFFERENT KINDS OF SECURITY-NATIONAL, PUBLIC/PRIVATE, AND HUMAN-AND OTHER CONCEPTS SUCH AS HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. A CONCEM WITH PUBLIC SECURITY IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH CONSETVATIVE POLITICAL FORCES-THE "LAW AND ORDER" OUTLOOK; THE RECIPROCAL CONCEM WITH HUMAN RIGHTS TENDS, FOR ITS PART, TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEFT. IN THE CURRENT POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CLIMATE OF MEXICO, THIS POLARIZATION IS UNNECESSARILY DETRIMENTAL TO HUMAN RIGHTS WORK. INDEED, THIS POLARIZATION NEED NOT HAPPEN; THE HUMAN RIGHTS AGENDA NEED NOT BE TRUMPED BY PUBLIC SECURITY. AS WITH MANY OTHER ISSUES IN MEXICO TODAY, THE MURDERS OF YOUNG WOMEN IN CIUDAD JUAREZ HAVE A LOT TO TELL US ABOUT GETTING OUT OF THE DILEMMA. THE PAPER WILL SHOW THAT, WHEN TAKEN TOGETHER, THE CONCEPTS AND CONCEMS OF PUBLIC SECURITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS LEAD TO A STRONG CONCEPT OF HUMAN SECURITY, LINKED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS GENERAL FRAMEWORK CONTRIBUTES, IN TURN, TO A DIM ASSESSMENT OF THE STATE OF MEXICO'S POST-AUTHORITARIAN (RATHER THAN DEMOCRATIE) TRANSITION.
330	AN EXTENSIVE LITERATURE HAS INVESTIGATED THE DRIVING FORCES BEHIND HIGH-TECHNOLOGY EXPORTS, BUT MOST STUDIES FOCUS ON DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES OUTSIDE AFRICA. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ASSESS THE MAIN FACTORS DETERMINING EXPORT-ORIENTED TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, USING THE TECHNOLOGICAL CONTENT OF EXPORTS (HIGH-TECH, MEDIUM-TECH AND LOW-TECH EXPORTS) AS A PROXY. FOR THIS PURPOSE, INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE REGRESSIONS ARE APPLIED TO A PANEL DATASET OF 33 AFRICAN COUNTRIES. THE FINDINGS REVEALED THAT THE MAIN DETERMINANTS OF HIGH-TECHNOLOGY EXPORTS ARE: IMPORTS OF COMPONENTS, RULE OF LAW, HUMAN CAPITAL, FDI INFLOWS, GDP PER CAPITA AND MANUFACTURING. FOR MEDIUM-TECHNOLOGY EXPORTS, THE DETERMINANTS IDENTIFIED ARE SIMILAR TO HIGH-TECHNOLOGY EXPORTS WITH POPULATION INCLUDED. THE MAIN DETERMINANTS OF LOW-TECHNOLOGY MANUFACTURED EXPORTS ARE IMPORTS OF COMPONENTS, RULE OF LAW, POPULATION, FDI INFLOWS, GDP PER CAPITA AND MANUFACTURING. THESE GIVE POLICYMAKERS IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES A TARGETED APPROACH IN FORMULATING POLICIES RELATED TO EXPORTS BY TECHNOLOGICAL CATEGORY. THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE IN THAT IT ASSESSES THE MAIN FACTORS DETERMINING EXPORT-ORIENTED TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, USING DIFFERENT LEVELS OF TECHNOLOGICAL CONTENT OF EXPORTS (HIGH-TECH, MEDIUM-TECH AND LOW-TECH EXPORTS).
331	THE AUTHOR ELABORATES ON THE EXTERNAL CAUSES AND OVERCOMING OF THE GLOBAL CRISIS IN 2008. THE MAIN EXTERNAL CAUSES OF THE CRISIS, AS CLAIMED BY COMPETENT AND REPUTABLE AUTHORS, ARE: THE POLICY OF LOW INTERESTS RATE OF U.S. FEDERAL BANK, CRISIS OF THE AMERICAN HYPOTHECARY MARKET, IRRESPONSIBILITY OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT, WRONGLY DIRECTED BUSINESS POLITICS OF CENTRAL BANKS, THE CRISIS OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANKING SYSTEM, THE IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE MARKET AND THE RULE OF LAW, MICROECONOMIC AND MACROECONOMIC MISTAKES, MASS SECURITIZATION OF NON-LIQUID ASSETS. THESE CAUSES PERMEATE: INSUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE OF EXPOSURE ON LIQUIDATION AND MARKET RISKS, BAD JUDGEMENTS, SPECULATIONS, LACK OF EFFICIENT BANKING CONTROL. MARKET FUNDAMENTALISM AND STATE INTERVENTIONISM ARE THE TWO OF MAIN DISAGREEMENTS ON THE ROLE OF MARKET, GOVERNMENT AND DEMOCRACY. A SOLUTION OF SUCH A DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THEM IS IN COOPERATION AND COMPLEMENTARITY. WITHOUT THE RECEPTION OF DEMOCRACY, PRINCIPLE EQUALITY-POWER, RULE OF LAW, TRUE RESPONSIBILITY, SOCIAL JUSTICE, GLOBAL JUSTICE, PREVENTIVE AND CONTROLLING MEASURES, AND THE NEW MODEL OF GUIDANCE ON A HIGHER LEVEL, WE CANNOT HOPE FOR OVERCOMING THE PRESENT GLOBAL CRISIS, OR GREED AND CORRUPTION IN GENERAL.
332	ESTABLISHING THE ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A PRECONDITION TO ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. INCREASINGLY HOWEVER NORMS AROUND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY ARE BEING ERODED BY RISING NEOLIBERALISM. WITHIN COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES THESE TRENDS ARE CREATING TENSIONS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY-MAKING THAT OFTEN REQUIRE ADJUDICATION/JUDICIAL INTERVENTION. IN THIS PAPER, WE USE THE CASE OF THE NATIONAL GREEN TRIBUNAL (NGT), SITUATED IN A RISING ECONOMY - INDIA TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT OPERATES AMIDST THESE TENSIONS, RESTRICTING OUR ANALYSIS TO PRE-COVID-19 TO MINIMISE CONFOUNDING EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC. WE FIND THAT THE LIMITED JURISDICTION ALLOWS THE NGT TO CONTINUE TO UPHOLD THE PRINCIPLES OF ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. THE NGT IS ABLE TO SERVE AS AN INDICATOR OF THE KINDS OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES CROPPING UP, DELIVER ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND IMPROVE GOVERNANCE. HOWEVER, THERE ARE VISIBLE TENSIONS DRIVEN BY THE LARGER POLITICAL ECONOMY OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICYMAKING IN INDIA THAT POSE A SIGNIFICANT SYSTEMIC CHALLENGE TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE NGT. GIVEN THE RESURGENCE OF ECONOMIC IMPERATIVES IN POST-PANDEMIC POLICYMAKING, THE NGT AND OTHER SIMILAR ENVIRONMENTAL COURTS/TRIBUNALS ACROSS THE GLOBE, NEED TO DRAW ON SOURCES OF STRENGTH ESTABLISHED PRE-PANDEMIC TO UPHOLD ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW GOING FORWARD.
333	THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON THE AMOUNT OF DISCLOSURE IN IPO FIRMS LISTING PROSPECTUSES USING THE SIX WELL ESTABLISHED WORLD BANK GOVERNANCE INDICES, NAMELY CORRUPTION CONTROL, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS IN PROMOTION OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE FROM TERRORISM, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND LASTLY DEMOCRATIC VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. USING A UNIQUE HAND-COLLECTED SAMPLE OF 165 IPO FIRMS FROM ACROSS AFRICA FROM 2000 TO 2011 I FIND EVIDENCE THAT ENHANCED RULE OF LAW AND REGULATORY QUALITY IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT OF DISCLOSURE BY FIRMS, REFLECTED IN LENGTH OF IPO LISTINGS PROSPECTUSES. IN ADDITION I FIND EVIDENCE THAT FOUNDER-LED ENTREPRENEURIAL FIRMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO DISCLOSE MORE ALONGSIDE FIRMS IN EXTRACTIVE AND TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES THAT RELY ON LOCAL STOCK EXCHANGES AS A SOURCE OF EXTERNAL FINANCE. IN CONTRAST IPO FIRMS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT LONG TERM FOREIGN PARTNERS OR ARE SUBSIDIARIES OF FOREIGN MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES ARE LIKELY TO DISCLOSE LESS THAN OTHER TYPES OF FIRM UNDERSCORING THEIR APATHY TO DOMESTIC INVESTORS AND RELATIVE LACK OF DEPENDENCE ON INDIGENOUS STOCK MARKETS AS A VIABLE SOURCE OF EXTERNAL FINANCE.

334	THE RULE OF LAW IS AN ESSENTIAL CONCEPT FOR THEORIES OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY, AND HAS FREQUENTLY BEEN HAILED IN THE REVOLUTIONARY RHETORIC HEARD THROUGHOUT POST-1989 EASTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE. IT WAS STRIKING THAT THOSE WHO HAD BEEN REPRESSED BY ARBITRARY POWER FOR SO LONG STILL HAD THE CAPACITY TO BELIEVE IN THIS IDEAL. FOR SCHOLARS INTERESTED IN THE ROLE LEGAL CULTURE PLAYS IN TRANSITIONAL POLITICS, AN IMPORTANT FOCUS FOR RESEARCH IS THE STRENGTH OF CULTURAL NORMS THAT SUPPORT OR UNDERMINE THE DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS. USING SURVEY DATA, THIS ARTICLE COMPARES THE LEGAL CULTURES OF THREE OF THE NEW DEMOCRACIES (BULGARIA, POLAND AND HUNGARY) WITH THOSE OF THREE OLDER DEMOCRACIES (SPAIN, FRANCE AND THE UNITED STATES). IT PRESENTS A MACRO-LEVEL COMPARISON OF LEGAL VALUES AND SOCIAL BELIEFS ACROSS THE SIX COUNTRIES, AND A MICRO-LEVEL ANALYSIS OF ATTITUDINAL DIFFERENCES ACROSS AGE COHORTS WITHIN EACH COUNTRY. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT POPULATIONS IN THE NEWER DEMOCRACIES ARE LESS SUPPORTIVE OF POLITICAL RIGHTS AND MORE SUPPORTIVE OF SOCIAL FAIRNESS THAN THOSE OF THE OLDER DEMOCRACIES, BUT THERE IS RELATIVELY LITTLE VARIATION ACROSS THIS SCALE OF DEMOCRATIZATION IN COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW.
335	THIS STUDY USES THE PANEL PROBIT MODEL TO INVESTIGATE AND EVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EXCHANGE RATE REGIMES, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND CARBON DIOXIDE DURING CURRENCY CRISES. TO UNDERSTAND CURRENCY CRISIS TIMES, WE STUDY A PANEL DATASET OF SEVEN SOUTH ASIAN NATIONS THAT CONTAIN ANNUAL OBSERVATIONS FROM 1996 TO 2020. FURTHERMORE, WE CREATED THE EMPI EXCHANGE MARKET PRESSURE INDICATOR TO DETECT CRISES. OUR RESULTS STRONGLY SUGGESTED THAT FIXED EXCHANGE RATE IS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENCY CRISES, WITH GOOD REGULATORY QUALITY AND BETTER EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENTS. SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE FLOATING EXCHANGE RATE IS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE CURRENCY CRISES IN THOSE COUNTRIES WHERE THE RULE OF LAW HAS LESS ADEQUATELY FLOWED. HOWEVER, CO2, EXPORTS, AND INTEREST RATES ARE BUOYANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH CRISES. THE FLOATING EXCHANGE RATE, THE RULE OF LAW, EXPORTS, AND INTEREST RATE ARE ASSOCIATED POSITIVELY AND CONTRIBUTE MORE PRONE TO THE CRISIS EPISODES. NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED VARIABLES CONTRIBUTED LESS AMID CRISES EPISODES: FIXED EXCHANGE RATE REGIME, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND REGULATORY QUALITY. MEANWHILE, CO2 HAS A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH A CURRENCY CRISIS AND CONTRIBUTES MORE LIKELIHOOD TO THE PROBABILITY OF A CURRENCY CRISIS. COUNTRIES THAT ADOPTED THE FIXED EXCHANGE RATES WITH EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORY QUALITY FACED MORE MINOR CURRENCY CRISES.
336	ALONG WITH POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGES, THE FALL OF THE SOCIALIST REGIMES IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE AND THE FORMER SOVIET UNION BROUGHT ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS. SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE CAUSES OF THE INCREASING UNHAPPINESS THAT ACCOMPANIED THE TRANSITION PROCESS, INCLUDING DETERIORATING PUBLIC GOODS, RISING INEQUALITY, INCOME VOLATILITY, STAGNATING LABOR MARKET CONDITIONS AND CHANGING NORMS. HOWEVER, FEW PAPERS HAVE SOUGHT EXPLANATIONS FOR THE LIFE SATISFACTION DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN TRANSITION AND NON-TRANSITION ECONOMIES. IN THIS PAPER, I SPECIFICALLY EXAMINE THE LIFE SATISFACTION GAP BETWEEN POST-SOCIALIST AND ADVANCED COUNTRIES AND THE ROLE OF POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS FOR EXPLAINING THIS GAP. MY RESULTS IMPLY THAT BOTH MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS AND THE RULE OF LAW EXPLAIN THE OVERALL LIFE SATISFACTION DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THE ADVANCED AND TRANSITION SOCIETIES. THE RULE OF LAW PLAYED AN ADDITIONAL ROLE IN REDUCING THE HAPPINESS GAP IN THE 1990S AND MAY HAVE EVEN REVERSED IT IN THE POST-CRISIS YEARS. AS INSTITUTIONS AND MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS CONTINUE TO IMPROVE, POST-SOCIALIST COUNTRIES MAY COMPLETE THEIR TRANSFORMATION PROCESSES AND ACHIEVE QUALITY-OF-LIFE LEVELS COMPARABLE WITH THOSE IN THE WEST.

337	SOCIOLEGAL SCHOLARS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY INTERESTED IN COMPARATIVE LEGAL CULTURES, LARGELY UNDER THE HYPOTHESES THAT WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE LAW AND THE VALUES EMBEDDED THEREIN HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH HOW THEY BEHAVE AND, ULTIMATELY, SOME CONSEQUENCES FOR THE LARGER POLITICAL AND LEGAL SYSTEMS. FOR INSTANCE, ATTITUDES TOWARD THE RULE OF LAW NO DOUBT INFLUENCE (THOUGH THEY DO NOT DETERMINE) PEOPLE'S WILLINGNESS TO COMPLY WITH LAWS. MOST AGREE THAT ONE CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF LAW IN SOCIETY WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING OF LEGAL CULTURES. WE PRESENT AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE LEGAL CULTURES OF THE COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. DRAWING ON MASS SURVEYS CONDUCTED WITHIN EACH OF THE COUNTRIES (INCLUDING A SEPARATE SAMPLE IN EAST GERMANY), WE EXPLORE POPULAR ATTITUDES TOWARD VARIOUS DIMENSIONS OF LAW: SUPPORT FOR THE RULE OF LAW; PERCEPTIONS THAT LAW IS A NONNEUTRAL, REPRESSIVE FORCE; AND SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY. ALTHOUGH OUR ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON NATIONAL DIFFERENCES, WE ALSO EXPLORE WITHIN-SYSTEM VARIATION (E.G., ACROSS VARIOUS SOCIOECONOMIC STRATA). ULTIMATELY, OUR PURPOSE IS TO DOCUMENT CROSS-NATIONAL DIFFERENCES IN LEGAL CULTURES AND TO RAKE SOME TENTATIVE STEPS TOWARD EXPLAINING THE ORIGINS OF THESE DIFFERENCES.
338	WE EXAMINE HOW THE SIZE AND THE COMPOSITION OF ACQUIRER BOARDS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SHAREHOLDER ABNORMAL RETURNS FOR 2,230 M&AS MADE BY LISTED FIRMS IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE. ALTHOUGH BOARD SIZE PROVES INSIGNIFICANT, OUR FINDINGS DO OFFER SOME EVIDENCE AS TO A BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF BOARD DIVERSITY ON M&A VALUE CREATION. GENDER DIVERSITY APPEARS MARGINALLY POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUIRER SHAREHOLDER ABNORMAL RETURNS. THE FRACTION OF FOREIGN DIRECTORS IS IN GENERAL NOT SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE, UNLESS THE RULE OF LAW IN THE ACQUIRER COUNTRY IS WEAK. NONETHELESS, NATIONALITY DIVERSITY IN THE BOARD TURNS OUT HARMFUL IN PURELY DOMESTIC TAKEOVERS. THE INFLUENCE OF AGE DIVERSITY IS MARGINALLY POSITIVE, YET ONLY IN DOMESTIC AND HORIZONTAL TAKEOVERS. NEXT, THE FRACTION OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS HAS A ROBUST POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE ACQUIRER CAR, WHILE DIRECTORS WITH MULTIPLE BOARD APPOINTMENTS PROVE VALUABLE ESPECIALLY THROUGH PREVENTING FIRMS FROM PURSUING POOR TAKEOVERS. FINALLY, CEO DUALITY IS DETRIMENTAL ONLY IN INDUSTRY-DIVERSIFYING DEALS INITIATED BY ACQUIRERS THAT ARE NOT CONTROLLED BY AN INDIVIDUAL OR A FAMILY SHAREHOLDER. ANY NEGATIVE CEO-DUALITY EFFECT IS MITIGATED WHEN THE ACQUIRER-COUNTRY RULE OF LAW IS STRONG.
339	THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO STUDY THE APPROACH OF THE THEORY OF THE STATE THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF THE IDEOLOGICAL ABSENCE OF POLITICAL PARTIES IN PERU -POLITICAL IDEOLOGY PROVIDES, FROM AN INITIAL PERSPECTIVE, A FRAME OF REFERENCE TO INTERPRET SOCIAL STIMULI, AS WELL AS A SERIES OF BELIEFS ABOUT HOW SOCIETY IS ORGANIZED; ON THE OTHER HAND, IDEOLOGY PROVIDES A SET OF BELIEFS ABOUT HOW SOCIETY SHOULD BE ORGANIZED IN ITS IDEAL FORM. THIS PROBLEMATIC REALITY LED TO THE EXECUTION OF THE PRESENT STUDY, FOR WHICH IT WAS FORMULATED AS A GENERAL PROBLEM: HOW DO IDEOLOGIES OF POLITICAL PARTIES IN PERU CONTRIBUTED TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW?, AND THE STUDY THAT WAS CARRIED OUT IS LOCATED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF BASIC RESEARCH, WHICH ACCORDING TO MIKOLAJEWICZ & KOMAROVA (2019) IS RESEARCH THAT SEEKS THE DISCOVERY OF NEW KNOWLEDGE THAT ARE PRESENTED IN REALITY THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC PROCEDURES; THEREFORE, IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS STUDY, KNOWLEDGE WAS SOUGHT OF HOW POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE IMPLEMENTED THEIR IDEOLOGY IN THE COMMUNITY AND HOW THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE IDEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW.
340	THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC CRISIS SERVES AS A GENUINE NATURAL EXPERIMENT FOR SOCIETIES WORLDWIDE, AS THE HEALTH-RELATED CRISIS ALLOWED GOVERNMENTS TO IMPLEMENT EXTREME MEASURES THAT IMPACTED PEOPLE???S RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, CHALLENGING THE BOUNDARIES OF DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW. IN THE CONTEXT OF RELIGIOUS LIFE, ROMANIA WAS POINTED BY THE OSCE AS BEING ONE OF THE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE OPTED FOR THE HARSHEST MEASURES TO RESTRICT RELIGIOUS LIFE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC. IN THIS PAPER WE PRESENT A CASE STUDY OF ROMANIA???S RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON RELIGIOUS LIFE DURING THE COVID-19 CRISIS, USING SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS STEMMING FROM THE UN, THE OSCE, THE COURT OF APPEAL OF BUCHAREST ETC., AS A FRAMEWORK TO OBJECTIVELY ANALYZE HOW THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD ACT REGARDING RELIGIOUS LIFE, BY ENFORCING THE PRINCIPLES ENSHRINED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS, ART. NO. 18. OUR MAIN FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT, IN ROMANIA, DURING THE PANDEMIC, THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON RELIGIOUS LIFE WERE POLITICALLY BARGAINED BY THE GOVERNMENT RATHER THAN BEING MEDIATED THROUGH NATIONAL LAW AND INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND COMMITMENTS ON FREEDOM OF RELIGION OR BELIEF AND BASED ON THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW.
341	IN THIS ARTICLE, THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS THE BASIC CHARACTER OF PUBLIC LAW IN THE COMMON LAW TRADITION BY RETURNING TO AV DICEY'S FAMOUS ASSERTION THAT PUBLIC LAW IS 'ORDINARY' LAW. DICEY MADE THIS CLAIM IN THE COURSE OF ARTICULATING A THEORY OF THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN THE COMMON LAW TRADITION, AND HE JUXTAPOSED THAT THEORY WITH THE IDEA OF PUBLIC LAW WITHIN THE CIVIL LAW TRADITION, USING FRENCH DROIT ADMINISTRATIF AS HIS CENTRAL TARGET OF ATTACK. DICEY'S IDEAS HAVE ATTRACTED CONSIDERABLE CRITICISM AND ARE NOW GENERALLY OUT OF FAVOUR. HOWEVER, ONCE THE IDEA OF PUBLIC LAW AS ORDINARY IS RECONSIDERED IN LIGHT OF ITS GENESIS WITHIN THE LONG HISTORY OF COMMON LAW DISCOURSE CONCERNING LAW AND STATE POWER, AND ONCE DICEY'S OWN EVOLVING ATTITUDES ABOUT FRENCH DROIT ADMINISTRATIF ARE CONSIDERED, THE IDEA CAN BE SEEN TO OFFER IMPORTANT INSIGHTS INTO THE IDEAL OF LEGALITY TODAY. THE CORE INSIGHT, IN THE END, IS THE SIMPLE IDEA THAT IF THE RULE OF LAW MEANS ANYTHING, THE LAW THAT RULES MUST EMBRACE THE QUALITIES THAT LAW ORDINARILY EMBRACES - THAT PUBLIC LAW IS, IN THE END, THE PRODUCT OF ORDINARY LEGAL METHOD.
342	THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE TENSION BETWEEN JUSTICE AND LEGALITY FACED BY NATIONAL JUDICIAL SYSTEMS IN THE CONTEXT OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE. THE RESPECTIVE POSITIONS TAKEN BY THE NATIONAL COURTS IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA AND THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECTHR) ARE ANALYSED ON THE FAIRNESS OF PUNISHMENT IN CASES CONCERNING DOMESTIC ATROCITY CRIMES AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT A POSITION OF STRICT LEGALITY WOULD NOT SERVE JUSTICE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME RESPECTING LEGALITY. TO SUPPORT THIS POSITION, THEORY AND PRACTICE RELATED TO THE APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY AND LEX MITIOR IN PARTICULAR, ARE EXAMINED. THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT VARIED UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY AND ITS RULES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE RULE OF LAW IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. FINALLY, THIS ARTICLE SUBMITS THAT THE ECTHR SHOULD ADOPT THE SO-CALLED 'NECESSITY TEST' TO ASSESS THE COMPATIBILITY OF LIMITATIONS TO THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY WITH INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW. IN THE AUTHOR'S VIEW, DOMESTIC JURISDICTIONS AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS BODIES SHOULD APPLY THIS TEST TO ENSURE A SATISFACTORY BALANCE BETWEEN JUSTICE AND LEGALITY, WHEN ADDRESSING RULE OF LAW DILEMMAS OF THE KIND DESCRIBED HEREIN.
343	WE EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF A COUNTRY'S GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT ON ITS PROPENSITY TO TRADE. USING AN UPDATED FRAMEWORK OF GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT, WE CLASSIFY COUNTRIES BASED ON THE DOMINANT MODE OF GOVERNANCE INTO THREE TYPES: (1) RULE-BASED (STRONG PUBLIC RULE OF LAW), (2) RELATION-BASED (WEAK RULE OF LAW AND STRONG INFORMAL NETWORK BASED ON PRIVATE RELATIONS), AND (3) FAMILY-BASED (ABSENCE OF BOTH PUBLIC RULES AND PRIVATE NETWORK). WE THEN EXAMINE HOW DIFFERENT GOVERNANCE TYPES AFFECT TRADE PATTERNS AMONG 44 COUNTRIES REPRESENTING 89% OF WORLD TRADE. WE FIND THAT OVERALL, RULE-BASED COUNTRIES TRADE MORE THAN RELATION-BASED OR FAMILY-BASED COUNTRIES. A LARGE POSITIVE EFFECT ON TRADE FLOWS EXISTS BETWEEN TWO HIGHLY RULE-BASED COUNTRIES AND BETWEEN TWO RELATION-BASED COUNTRIES. ANY TRADE RELATIONSHIP INVOLVING A FAMILY-BASED COUNTRY NEGATIVELY AFFECTS TRADE FLOWS, EVEN BETWEEN TWO FAMILY-BASED COUNTRIES. OUR STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE TRADE LITERATURE BY EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT ON TRADE FLOWS AND MORE SUCCESSFULLY EXPLAINING WHY SOME COUNTRIES STILL TRADE ALMOST NOTHING EVEN AFTER SCHOLARS AND POLICY MAKERS HAVE CONVINCINGLY PROVEN THAT FREER TRADE LEADS TO HIGHER WELFARE FOR A COUNTRY.

344	THIS ARTICLE IS A CONTINUATION OF PART 1 WHICH APPEARED IN THE PREVIOUS ISSUE OF TRUSTS AND TRUSTEES. THE CONCLUDING NOTE THERE WAS THAT PRIVILEGE IN MALTA IS ONE AND UNITARY, ENCOMPASSING WITHOUT DISTINCTION LITIGATION PRIVILEGE AND LEGAL ADVICE PRIVILEGE. PART 2 ARGUES THAT MALTA HAS RECEIVED VARIOUS INFLUENCES OVER TIME ON PRIVILEGE, NOT LEAST THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE EU. HOWEVER, THE LAW ON PRIVILEGE SHOULD NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THE FUNDAMENTAL AND DEFINING LINK BETWEEN THE MALTESE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE AND THE TRADITIONAL COMMON LAW RULES ON EVIDENCE-THESE SHOULD REMAIN, PARTLY AT LEAST, A DEFINING ANCHOR OF THE MALTESE LAW ON PRIVILEGE. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT PRIVILEGE EXTENDS TO ALL MATERIALS COMMUNICATED BETWEEN COUNSEL AND CLIENT IN THE PROPER COURSE OF PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITY. IT ALSO REVIEWS AREAS SUCH AS DISCLOSURE AND PRIVILEGE, ASKS WHETHER PRIVILEGE IS A SUBSTANTIVE RULE OF LAW OR ONE OF EVIDENCE. OTHER AREAS CONSIDERED ARE LOSS OF PRIVILEGE, PARTIAL WAIVER THEREOF, SECONDARY EVIDENCE REFERRED TO IN OTHERWISE PRIVILEGED MATERIAL AND FINALLY INADVERTENT DISCLOSURE. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT PRIVILEGE IS A DEEP-SEATED RULE OF LAW, PROCEDURE AND PRACTICE OF WHICH ADVOCATES AND THE JUDICIARY REMAIN THE GATEKEEPERS.
345	THIS STUDY ASSESSES THE SYNERGY EFFECTS OF GOVERNANCE IN MOBILE PHONE PENETRATION FOR INCLUSIVE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA WITH DATA FOR THE PERIOD 2000-2012. IT EMPLOYS A BATTERY OF INTERACTIVE ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES, NAMELY: FIXED EFFECTS, GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENTS AND TOBIT REGRESSIONS. CONCEPTS OF POLITICAL (VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND POLITICAL STABILITY/NO VIOLENCE), ECONOMIC (GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND REGULATION QUALITY) AND INSTITUTIONAL (CORRUPTION-CONTROL AND RULE OF LAW) GOVERNANCE ARE EMPLOYED. THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS ARE ESTABLISHED. THE PREVIOUSLY APPARENT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN MOBILE PHONES AND INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT CAN BE EXTENDED TO A POSITIVE EFFECT. ALTHOUGH POLITICAL GOVERNANCE IS OVERWHELMINGLY NOT SIGNIFICANT ACROSS ESTIMATED MODELS, THE AVERAGE EFFECTS FROM ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE ARE HIGHER RELATIVE TO INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE. ON THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MOBILE PHONES AND GOVERNANCE VARIABLES, WHILE NONE ARE APPARENT IN FIXED EFFECTS REGRESSIONS, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT SYNERGY EFFECTS IN GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENTS AND TOBIT ESTIMATIONS, NOTABLY, FROM: REGULATION QUALITY IN THE FORMER AND POLITICAL STABILITY, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND RULE OF LAW IN THE LATTER. THERE IS CONSISTENT EVIDENCE OF CONVERGENCE IN INCLUSIVE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED. (C) 2016 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
346	IN THE MESSY WORLD OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE, THE PRINCIPLE OF SUBSIDIARITY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ORDER RELATIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT LAYERS OF GOVERNANCE AS WELL AS COMPENSATE FOR THE LEGITIMACY DEFICIT OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS. HOWEVER, SUBSIDIARITY HAS RECEIVED SURPRISINGLY LITTLE SCHOLARLY ATTENTION IN THE DISCIPLINE OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. THIS ARTICLE THEREFORE SEEKS TO EXAMINE THE PROMISES AND PERILS OF SUBSIDIARITY IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE BY ADDUCING EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM AFRICA, A REGION WHICH HAS AUTHORED NORMS AND POLICIES THAT OFTEN CONTEST GLOBAL NORMS AND INSTITUTIONS. BASED ON TWO CASE STUDIES OF PRO-DEMOCRATIC INTERVENTION IN THE GAMBIA AND COURT PROLIFERATION AT THE (SUB-)REGIONAL LEVELS, THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT WHILE SUBSIDIARITY MAY STRENGTHEN DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, IT MAY ALSO UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL, AS WELL AS DILUTE FUNDAMENTAL GLOBAL NORMS THAT SERVE TO PROTECT BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS. AT THE SAME TIME, SUBSIDIARITY PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR NORMATIVE INNOVATION, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT MORE ATTENTION NEEDS TO BE PAID TO THE LAW-GENERATING EFFECTS OF SUBSIDIARITY AND TO THE GLOBAL SOUTH AS AN AGENT OF CHANGE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND GLOBAL GOVERNANCE.
347	THE FIRST EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION IS CONDUCTED INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOUR AND TAX MORALE IN THE CONTEXT OF STATE CAPACITY BUILDING AS IN THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES. WE CONSIDER 'PUBLIC SPIRIT' (A POSITIVE ATTITUDE ADOPTED BY CITIZENS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMUNITY) AND ASSOCIATIONAL ACTIVITY (INDIVIDUALS' ENGAGEMENT IN VOLUNTARY ACTIVITIES) TWO MAJOR EXPRESSIONS OF PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOUR AND ESTIMATE THEIR IMPACT ON PALESTINIANS' 'TAX MORALE' (INTRINSIC MOTIVATION TO PAY TAXES). THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS EMPLOYS A UNIQUE PALESTINIAN PUBLIC OPINION SURVEY CONDUCTED IN 2007 IN THE WEST BANK AND THE GAZA STRIP. BY USING A BIVARIATE PROBIT MODEL, WE FIND THAT TAX MORALE INCREASES WITH PUBLIC SPIRIT BUT IT IS LOWER AMONG PALESTINIANS INVOLVED IN ASSOCIATIONAL ACTIVITIES. PREDICTED CONDITIONAL PROBABILITIES INDICATE THAT PUBLIC SPIRIT HAS MORE IMPACT WHEN THE RESPONDENT HAS LOW CONFIDENCE IN THE INSTITUTIONS AND IN THE RULE OF LAW. FINALLY, MORE PUBLIC SPIRIT IS REQUIRED FOR A SELF-EMPLOYED PERSON IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH TAX COMPLIANCE THAN FOR A WORKER IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR, UNLESS THE WORKER IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR HAS LOWER CONFIDENCE IN THE INSTITUTIONS AND IN THE RULE OF LAW THAN THE SELF-EMPLOYED PERSON.
348	STANDING RULES PERSIST DESPITE JUDICIAL RESERVATIONS ABOUT THEIR POTENTIAL FOR INTERFERING WITH THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES JUDGES' JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THE CONTINUED ROLE OF STANDING RULES, AND THEN, ON THE BASIS OF AN ANALYSIS OF HIGHER COURT STANDING CASES DECIDED BETWEEN 1980-2006, CONSIDERS THE DEGREE TO WHICH STANDING RULES ARE NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THOSE PURPOSES. IT ARGUES THAT STANDING RULES ARE RARE, THAT THEY ARE ALMOST NEVER CONCLUSIVE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW CASES. BUT STANDING RULES DO SOMETIMES FILTER OUT CASES WHICH OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE PROCEEDED TO TRIAL. MOST WOULD PROBABLY NOT HAVE RESULTED IN A FINDING IN THE PLAINTIFF'S FAVOUR, BUT SOME WOULD. STANDING RULES THEREFORE INVOLVE SACRIFICING THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE INTERESTS AT THE EXPENSE OF COLLECTIVE INTERESTS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY MAY CONTRIBUTE TO EXPEDITIOUS DECISION-MAKING AND THE PROTECTION OF DEFENDANTS FROM THE COSTS OCCASIONED BY UNMERITORIOUS LITIGATION. THE WEIGHT TO BE ATTACHED TO THESE CONFLICTING CONSIDERATIONS WILL VARY BY CONTEXT, AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE DIVERSITY OF STATUTORY STANDING REGIMES, AND IN JUDICIAL DECISIONS WHICH OFTEN SEEM TO REFLECT LEGISLATIVE POLICIES.
349	THE EUROPEAN BUDGET SITS AT THE CORE OF INITIATIVES FOR RECOVERY FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE EUROPEAN RECOVERY PLAN BRINGS TOGETHER AREAS THAT HAD EVOLVED APART SO FAR, SUCH AS ECONOMIC POLICY COORDINATION, EUROPEAN BUDGETARY LAW, COHESION POLICY AND THE DEFENCE OF RULE OF LAW. THIS STUDY REVIEWS AND INTERLINKS THE PILLARS ON WHICH THE EUROPEAN BUDGET WILL BE BASED IN THE ON-GOING SEVEN-YEAR PERIOD. THE SCOPE OF ANALYSIS OF THE NEW LEGAL INSTRUMENTS ADOPTED COVERS THE OWN RESOURCES DECISION, THE EUROPEAN RECOVERY INSTRUMENT, THE MULTIANNUAL FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK, THE RECOVERY AND RESILIENCE MECHANISM AND THE REGULATION ON BUDGET CONDITIONALITY FOR THE RULE OF LAW. THE RELAXATION, DUE TO THE PANDEMIC, OF PRINCIPLES AND LIMITS THAT SEEMED IMMOVABLE HITHERTO SUGGESTS PROGRESS AND DEEPENING IN THE EUROPEAN INTEGRATION PROCESS, PAVING THE WAY TOWARDS A FISCAL UNION, A PERSPECTIVE THAT FACES CONFLICTING REACTIONS AND CONSTITUTIONAL BOUNDARIES AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. OUR FINDINGS SHOW, HOWEVER, THAT INTERGOVERNMENTAL FEATURES PREDOMINATE IN THE GOVERNANCE OF THE NEW BUDGETARY FRAMEWORK, ADDING A CAUTIONARY NOTE AS TO WHETHER THE SUPRANATIONAL INSTITUTIONS THAT EMBODY DEMOCRATIC CONTROL WILL BE ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR FUNCTION.
350	THE MODERN INVESTOR-STATE ARBITRATION REGIME WAS EXPLICITLY DESIGNED TO REPLACE COMMERCIAL DIPLOMACY AS A MECHANISM FOR PROTECTING FOREIGN INVESTMENT. I ARGUE, HOWEVER, THAT DIPLOMACY CONTINUES TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MANAGING POLITICAL RISK, PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES WITH WEAK RULE OF LAW. YET, SINCE COMMERCIAL DIPLOMACY OCCURS PRIMARILY BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO OBSERVE, LET ALONE TEST FOR ITS EFFECTS. TO OVERCOME THIS OBSTACLE, I EXPLOIT VARIATION IN VACANCIES AMONG US AMBASSADORS TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES-CONDITIONS OVERWHELMINGLY DRIVEN BY US DOMESTIC POLITICAL FACTORS-WHICH PROVIDES FOR A QUASI-NATURAL EXPERIMENT FOR TESTING THE EFFECTS OF COMMERCIAL DIPLOMACY. I SHOW THAT AMERICAN FIRMS OPERATING ABROAD ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO INITIATE INVESTOR-STATE ARBITRATION DISPUTES DURING TEMPORARY VACANCIES IN US AMBASSADORSHIPS. THE EFFECTS OF THESE VACANCIES PROVE PARTICULARLY STRONG IN COUNTRIES WITH WEAK RULE OF LAW. THE RESULTS SUGGEST AMERICAN INVESTORS FREQUENTLY SEEK ASSISTANCE FROM THE US GOVERNMENT IN INFORMALLY RESOLVING INCIPIENT INVESTMENT DISPUTES; IF DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS ARE UNSUCCESSFUL OR UNAVAILABLE, INVESTORS THEN FILE FORMAL ARBITRATION CASES. THESE FINDINGS UNDERLINE THAT, EVEN IN HIGHLY LEGALIZED ISSUE AREAS IN WORLD POLITICS, SUCH AS INVESTMENT PROTECTION, INFORMAL DIPLOMACY CONTINUES TO INFLUENCE IMPORTANT POLITICAL ECONOMY OUTCOMES.
351	GLOBALIZATION AS A HISTORICAL PROCESS IS SEEN TO INVOLVE AT LEAST THREE DIMENSIONS. FIRST, SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR, ACCELERATING ESPECIALLY IN THIS LAST DECADE, THE 'THEATRE' OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES HAS MOVED FROM THE NATION-STAGE TO A LARGER STAGE. SECOND, THIS HAS ALSO LED TO A CHANGE IN MAJOR PLAYERS WHO USED TO BE NATION-STATE GOVERNMENTS. THE COMBINED EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN BOTH THEATRE AND MAJOR PLAYERS ALSO LEADS TO A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN THE SCRIPT ITSELF, CHARACTERIZED BY PRIVATE OVER PUBLIC AGENTS. AT THE LIMIT MOST, IF NOT ALL, DECISIONS MAY END UP BEING TAKEN BY MARKET MECHANISMS. A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR A MARKET SYSTEM IS THE EXISTENCE OF AN OUTSIDE UMPIRE TO ENSURE RULE OF LAW. THE NEW POTENTIAL UMPIRES AND GUARANTORS OF RULE OF LAW ARE IGOS BUT BEFORE THEY CAN BE EFFECTIVE THEY HAVE TO BE REDESIGNED ALMOST FROM SCRATCH. TO SUM UP, GLOBALIZATION NEEDS NEW FORMS OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE-OTHERWISE THE MARKET MAY WELL SELF-DESTRUCT. THE OVERALL PROGNOSIS FOR THE WORLD SYSTEM REMAINS VERY GOOD BUT STAGE MANAGERS ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT THE PLAY DOES NOT BECOME A THEATRE OF THE ABSURD.
352	THE ARAB CITIZENS OF ISRAEL LIVED UNTIL THE LATE 1940S IN SELF-SUFFICIENT, SEMI-AUTONOMOUS VILLAGES, WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THEM WERE PEASANTS WHO FINISHED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AT MOST. DURING THE 1950S AND 1960S, THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL STARTED TO ESTABLISH LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES, WHOSE HEAD AND COUNCIL WOULD BE ELECTED IN FREE AND FAIR DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES, FIRST, HOW THE TRADITIONAL SOCIAL UNIT, THE CLAN OR EXTENDED FAMILY, HAS DOMINATED THE DEMOCRATIC MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS SINCE THEIR ESTABLISHMENT. SECOND, WHAT IS THE STRENGTH OF THE MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS IN UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW AND EXTRACTING DIRECT PROPERTY TAXES FROM A CLAN SOCIETY? THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THE MUNICIPAL INSTITUTION IN THE ARAB TOWNS HAS EMERGED AS A WEAK INSTITUTION THAT HAS BEEN UNABLE TO IMPOSE THE RULE OF LAW OR EXTRACT TAXES FROM THE VILLAGE RESIDENTS, THUS PROVIDING POOR SERVICES TO THE RESIDENTS IN RETURN. THIS WEAKNESS AND POOR PERFORMANCE IS ATTRIBUTED TO TWO FACTORS: DISCRIMINATION BY THE STATE OF ISRAEL IN ALLOCATING RESOURCES TO THE ARAB MUNICIPALITIES AND THE CLAN POLITICS THAT HAS OBSTRUCTED THE MUNICIPAL ATTEMPTS OF PENETRATING SOCIETY AND EXTRACTING TAXES.
353	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE SHAPED IN THE CHECHEN DIASPORA IN NORWAY. TAKING AS OUR POINT OF DEPARTURE STUDIES OF LEGAL PLURALISM AND THE CO-EXISTENCE OF TRADITIONAL ADAT, RELIGIOUS SHARIA AND RUSSIAN SECULAR LAW IN CHECHNYA, WE EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF LIVING IN A HOST COUNTRY BY ASKING: HOW DO MEMBERS OF THE CHECHEN DIASPORA, HERE DEFINED AS CONFLICT-GENERATED DIASPORA, VIEW AND INTERNALIZE LEGAL MODELS IN NORWAY? WHAT TYPE OF STATE GOVERNANCE DO THEY SEE AS IDEAL FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR CHECHNYA IN THE FUTURE? FURTHER: WHAT MIGHT THE UNDERLYING EXPLANATION FOR THEIR CHOICES BE? WE ASSUME THAT JUST AS DIFFERENT WAVES OF VIOLENCE IN CHECHNYA CREATED DIFFERENT DIASPORA COMMUNITIES THAT TODAY EXHIBIT SPECIFIC SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND POLITICAL TRAITS, THE LATEST WAVE OF FORCED EMIGRATION TO EUROPE AFTER THE POST-SOVIET RUSSO-CHECHEN WARS MAY HAVE MADE SPECIFIC IMPRINTS ON THE LEGAL PREFERENCES OF THIS DIASPORA. THE PICTURE THAT EMERGES FROM OUR IN-DEPTH INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS AND SURVEYS IS ONE OF GRADUAL ADAPTATION AND ADJUSTMENT TO NORWEGIAN STATE GOVERNANCE AND RULE OF LAW, DEMONSTRATING THE COMPLEX AND CO-CONSTITUTIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CHANGING IDENTITIES AND LEGAL PREFERENCES.
354	ESCALATION OF GREAT POWER RIVALRY RESULTING FROM CHINA'S RISE AND RUSSIA'S INVASION OF UKRAINE HAS PROMPTED JAPAN TO ALIGN ITS FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICIES MORE CLOSELY. THIS PAPER ANALYZES HOW ODA POLICY, WHICH THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT REGARDS AS A CRUCIAL DIPLOMATIC INSTRUMENT, HAS BEEN MODIFIED IN THE FACE OF THESE CHANGES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TRANSFORMATION IS THE SECURITIZATION OF ODA, OR THE DEPLOYMENT OF ODA TO ADVANCE JAPAN'S NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS. THIS TREND IS EVIDENT IN THE EMERGENCE OF A NEW TYPE OF ODA THAT AIMS TO CONTRIBUTE TO JAPAN'S SECURITY INTERESTS BY STRENGTHENING THE DETERRENCE CAPABILITIES OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES INVOLVED IN TERRITORIAL DISPUTES WITH CHINA. NOTABLY, JAPAN IS JUSTIFYING THIS NEW ODA TREND IN THE NAME OF UPHOLDING THE UNIVERSAL VALUE OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. IN OTHER WORDS, JAPAN IS SHIFTING THE FOCUS OF ASSISTANCE AWAY FROM DOMESTIC ISSUES OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN EACH RECIPIENT COUNTRY TOWARD THE RULE OF LAW IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. THIS IS A MANIFESTATION OF JAPAN'S EFFORT TO STRIKE A CAREFUL BALANCE BETWEEN UPHOLDING UNIVERSAL VALUES AND AVOIDING THE RISK OF OFFENDING INCUMBENT GOVERNMENTS IN RECIPIENT COUNTRIES WITH QUESTIONABLE DOMESTIC GOVERNANCE RECORDS.
355	CADRES AND CIVIL SERVANTS ARE PEOPLE WORKING IN THE PUBLIC AGENCIES OF VIETNAM. ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CADRES AND CIVIL SERVANTS ARE MANDATORY REGULATION FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES, DEMONSTRATING THE SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY OF CADRES AND CIVIL SERVANTS FOR THEIR ASSIGNED TASKS. THE SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR PERFORMING TASKS WHEN ASSIGNED BY THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM (PARTY), GOVERNMENT, OR SUPERIORS, WHETHER BIG OR SMALL JOBS, DIFFICULT OR EASY TASKS, ETC. ALL MUST BE DONE UNTIL THE END, OVERCOME ALL DIFFICULTIES, AND MAKE IT SUCCESSFUL. BECAUSE, THE NATURE OF THE STATE OF VIETNAM AS STATED CONSTITUTION (2013) IS "A SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW STATE, OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE". THEREFORE, PERFORMING ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE PEOPLE IS AN OBVIOUS OBLIGATION OF THE STATE IN GENERAL AND OF CADRES AND CIVIL SERVANTS. WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARTICLE, THE AUTHORS FOCUS ON ANALYZING ACCOUNTABILITY TO SERVE AS A BASIS FOR PROPOSING SOLUTIONS TO TIGHTEN DISCIPLINE, ADMINISTRATIVE DISCIPLINE, AND FORMS OF DISCIPLINING OFFICIALS AND CIVIL SERVANTS IN THE CONTEXT OF INTERNATIONAL INTEGRATION TO SUIT REALITY, AND AT THE SAME TIME, CONTRIBUTE TO BUILDING AND PERFECTING THE SOCIALIST RULE-OF-LAW STATE OF VIETNAM IN A BETTER AND GREATER NEW PERIOD.
356	THE PROTECTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY AGAINST TERRORIST AND RELATED ACTIVITIES ACT 33 OF 2004 IS AIMED AT CREATING A LEGAL MACHINERY TO COUNTER ANY DOMESTIC THREAT OF TERRORISM AND GIVE EFFECT TO SOUTH AFRICA'S INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS TO COUNTER INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE SCOPE OF THE ACT, WHICH IS DEFINED BY ITS DEFINITION OF A 'TERRORIST ACT', IS VAGUE AND REACHES FAR BEYOND ANY CONVENTIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT TERRORISM IS THE INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS ON CIVILIANS TO ACHIEVE A POLITICAL PURPOSE. AT THE SAME TIME IT ATTEMPTS TO INSULATE THE ACTIONS OF 'FREEDOM FIGHTERS' FROM THE SCOPE OF THE ACT. THIS DEFINITION WILL MAKE ADJUDICATION UNDER THE ACT AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION VERY DIFFICULT. THE ACT IS THEREFORE VULNERABLE TO CONSTITUTIONAL SCRUTINY ON THE GROUNDS OF LEGALITY. THE ARTICLE ALSO EXAMINES THE FAILURE OF MANY COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, TO COMPLY WITH THE RULE OF LAW IN COUNTERING THE THREAT POSED BY TERRORISM. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT COOPERATING WITH COUNTRIES WHOSE COUNTER-TERRORISM POLICIES ARE INIMICAL TO THE RULE OF LAW WOULD FALL FOUL OF SOUTH AFRICA'S OWN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS TO PROMOTE AND TO PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS.
357	ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT INFORMATION IN ELECTRONIC FORM IS ESSENTIAL TO THE REALIZATION OF A CIVIL SOCIETY, DEMOCRATIZATION, AND A RULE OF LAW. FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ISSUES ARE CENTRALLY IMPORTANT IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, AND THE INTERNET'S WORLD WIDE WEB OFFERS THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AT LOW COST. ACHIEVING A SOUND INFORMATION POLICY TO PROMOTE OPEN GOVERNMENT REQUIRES CONSTANT VIGILANCE BY THOSE WHO CARE ABOUT THE GOAL, THE GREATEST THREAT IS STATE SPONSORED MONOPOLY. STATE SPONSORED MONOPOLIES ARE INIMICAL TO OPEN GOVERNMENT AND RULE OF LAW BECAUSE THEY OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF CENSORSHIP, BECAUSE THEY RAISE PRICES AND INCREASE COST, AND BECAUSE THEY DEPRIVE THE PUBLIC OF NEW TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS. AGENCIES SHOULD NEVER SEEK TO RESTRICT REDISSEMINATION OR TO PRESCRIBE PRICES AT WHICH INFORMATION MAY BE DISTRIBUTED TO REDISSEMINATED. COPYRIGHT LAW MAY BE INTERPRETED TO EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF COPYRIGHT IN BASIC PUBLIC INFORMATION. FINALLY, THE PROPOSED DATABASE PROTECTION TREATY NOW PENDING BEFORE THE WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ORGANIZATION SHOULD BE OPPOSED, UNLESS DRAFTERS ADD A COMPULSORY LICENSE PROVISION TO MANDATE MULTIPLE SOURCES AND CHANNELS FOR PUBLIC INFORMATION LOCKED UP BY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND DATABASE RIGHTS.
358	THE PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO DETERMINE THE APPROACHES TO UNDERSTAND THE EMERGENCE OF THE CONCEPT OF "USURPATION OF POWER". ACCORDINGLY, ITS POLITICAL AND LEGAL NATURE AS A PHENOMENON IS ANALYZED AND THE INVESTIGATION OF ITS INFLUENCE ON THE BRANCHES OF PUBLIC POWER IS CARRIED OUT. IN ADDITION, THE CURRENT DISCUSSION IS EXAMINED AND THE VIEWS OF SOME SCIENTISTS ON THIS ISSUE ARE CRITICIZED AND, AT THE SAME TIME, RELEVANT PROPOSALS ARE MADE. THE METHODOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE RESEARCH WAS CONSTITUTED BY THE COMPARATIVE-LEGAL AND SYSTEMIC ANALYSIS, THE FORMAL-LEGAL METHOD, THE HERMENEUTIC METHOD AND THE METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS. AS A CONCLUSION IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND CIVIL SOCIETY IN UKRAINE REQUIRES, FIRST OF ALL, ONTOLOGICAL INTEGRATION OF THE MODERN AND CURRENT CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND SOCIETY, ALONG WITH THE OBSERVANCE OF LEGAL NORMS IN ALL SPHERES OF PUBLIC LIFE AND; ESPECIALLY, IT DEMANDS THE PREVENTION OF CONDITIONS THAT DETERMINE THE USURPATION OF POWER BY CIVIL SOCIETY, JUDICIAL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT BODIES TO PREVENT SIGNS OF USURPATION OF POWER IN PUBLIC AUTHORITIES.
359	THIS PAPER ASSESSES TO WHAT EXTENT THE NEO-REPUBLICAN ACCOUNTS OF QUENTIN SKINNER AND PHILIP PETTIT ADEQUATELY CAPTURE THE NATURE OF POLITICAL LIBERTY AT ROME BY FOCUSING ON CICERO'S ANALYSIS OF THE LIBERA RES PUBLICA. CICERO'S ANALYSIS IN DE REPUBLICA SUGGESTS THAT THE RULE OF LAW AND A MODEST MENU OF INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS' RIGHTS GUARD AGAINST CITIZENS BEING CONTROLLED BY A MASTER'S ARBITRARY WILL, THEREBY ENSURING THE STATUS OF NON-DOMINATION THAT CONSTITUTES FREEDOM ACCORDING TO THE NEO-REPUBLICAN VIEW. HE ALSO SHOWS THE DIFFICULTY OF ANCHORING AN ARGUMENT FOR CITIZENS' FULL POLITICAL PARTICIPATION IN THE VALUE OF NON-DOMINATION. WHILE CICERO BELIEVED SUCH FULL PARTICIPATION (BY ELITE CITIZENS) WAS ESSENTIAL FOR A LIBERA RES PUBLICA, HE, LIKE OTHER ELITE ROMANS, ARGUED FOR PARTICIPATION ON THE BASIS OF LIBERTY CONCEIVED AS THE SPACE TO CONTEND FOR AND ENHANCE ONE'S SOCIAL STATUS. THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE RULE OF LAW AND CITIZENS' RIGHTS FOR SECURING A STATUS OF NON-DOMINATION TAKEN TOGETHER WITH THEIR INSUFFICIENCY FOR ENSURING A LIBERA RES PUBLICA SUGGESTS THAT NEO-REPUBLICAN ACCOUNTS OF LIBERTY DO NOT FULLY CAPTURE THE IDEA AS ARTICULATED IN CICERO'S REPUBLICANISM.
360	THE PATH TOWARDS THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW'S STATE INCLUDES THE NEED FOR EMPHASIS OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. IT'S NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE VEIL OFF OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS PRESENT IN THE CONSTITUTION, ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES WITH PROFOUND SOCIAL INEQUALITIES, SUCH AS BRAZIL. IS THIS MANNER, TAKING IN CONSIDERATION THE ROLE OF HERMENEUTICS, SOME NOTIONS THAT INVOLVE RULE OF LAW INTERPRETATION ARE DEVELOPED, INCLUDING THE PROGRESS OF THE HEIDEGERIAN- GADAMERIAN PHILOSOPHY, AS WELL AS THE INFLUENCE OF THESE AUTHORS TO CONTEMPORARY LAW, AS A WAY TO AVOID EARLY DECISIONS AND ARBITRARINESS. IN SEQUENCE, THE TRANSFORMATION SUFFERED BY JURISDICTION WITH THE ADVENT OF NEO CONSTITUTIONALISM IS HIGHLIGHTED. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE DISCURSIVE/ARGUMENTATIVE THEORIES AND HERMENEUTICS ARE NOT MEANT TO BE FINAL, ONLY TO TRACE ASPECTS IN ORDER TO HELP THE SEARCH FOR THE BEST SUITED HERMENEUTICS ANSWER IN EACH CASE. SHOULD THE RESEARCH POINT TOWARDS A DIALECTICIAN APPROACH, A TRADITIONAL METHODOLOGY WON'T BE USED, SINCE THE METHODS ARE CLOSED TO REALITY AND CAN BE ALL AND NONE AT THE SAME TIME. THEREFORE, WE SEE THAT PHENOMENOLOGY HERMENEUTICS IS THE BEST SUITED FOR THE GOALS OF THIS ARTICLE.
361	ORGANIZED CRIME, ALONG WITH TERRORISM, DRUGS, CORRUPTION AND CYBER-CRIME REMAIN AMONG THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THREATS TO SECURITY AND CO-OPERATION IN THE OSCE REGION. WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED OVER THESE YEARS AND WHAT ELSE STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT ORGANIZED CRIME DOES NOT HINDER SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE AREA FROM VANCOUVER TO VLADIVOSTOK? TO EFFECTIVELY DEFEND THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF 1.2 BILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN THE REGION, THE OSCE HAS TO REVIEW ITS ANTI-CRIME TOOLBOX FROM TIME TO TIME, TO STRENGTHEN ITS CO-OPERATION WITH OTHER INTERESTED PARTNERS AND TO DEVELOP NEW MECHANISMS OF COOPERATION AMONG ITS 57 PARTICIPATING STATES. THIS ARTICLE WILL FOCUS ON THE ONGOING EFFORTS BY THE OSCE TO COMBAT ORGANIZED CRIME THROUGH POLICE CO-OPERATION.
362	THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE POSITIVE EVOLUTION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IN THE PAST CENTURY, AND THE EMERGENCE OF A RULES-BASED MULTILATERAL SYSTEM UNDER THE UN CHARTER, WHICH HAS,INTER ALIA, ENABLED FORMERLY COLONISED PEOPLES TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION AND PROHIBITED THE USE OF FORCE IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. THE AUTHOR REAFFIRMS HIS FAITH IN THE ABILITY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW TO PROVIDE A COMMON LANGUAGE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO FACE SUCCESSFULLY COMMON CHALLENGES, SUCH AS POVERTY, GLOBAL WARMING, AND THE PROTECTION OF PRIVACY RIGHTS IN THE ERA OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. LOOKING BEYOND TRADITIONAL BENEFICIARIES AND DUTY-BEARERS OF INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS, THE AUTHOR MAKES A CASE FOR ALL ACTORS TO ENGAGE IN RESPECTING, UPHOLDING AND PROMOTING INTERNATIONAL LAW.
363	DESPITE THE PROMISE TO ADDRESS SOCIOECONOMIC INJUSTICES AND UNEMPLOYMENT, THESE ISSUES REMAIN IN POLITICAL AND PUBLIC DEBATES IN 'DEMOCRATIZING' TUNISIA WITHOUT HAVING NO RADICAL AND SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO RESOLVING THEM IN PLACE. THE EXISTING LITERATURE NOTES THAT TUNISIA'S 'TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY' HAS BEEN LARGELY SHAPED BY THE OLD NEOLIBERAL APPROACH, LEADING MANY YOUTHS TO TAKE TO THE STREET AGAIN. THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE AND MORE BROADLY TO THE STUDY OF RESISTANCE IN NEOLIBERAL TIMES BY EXPLORING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE POST-2011 TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE REGIME'S GOVERNING THROUGH RIGHTS AND JUSTICE AND THE MAFROUZEEN AMNIYA MOVEMENT, WHICH CONSISTS OF A GROUP OF UNEMPLOYED PROTESTERS WHO CLAIM THAT THEIR RIGHT TO WORK WAS VIOLATED BY THE STATE AS A RESULT OF THEIR PROTESTS AGAINST THE AUTHORITARIAN REGIME. DRAWING ON CRITICAL APPROACHES TO NEOLIBERALISM, HUMAN RIGHTS AND SOCIAL MOVEMENTS, I ARGUE THAT TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IN TUNISIA PARTLY SERVED NEOLIBERAL GOVERNING BY MARGINALIZING REVOLUTIONARY DEMANDS FOR STRUCTURAL CHANGES AND SOCIAL JUSTICE AND PROMOTING INDIVIDUALIZED FORMS OF HUMAN RIGHTS. CRUCIALLY, THE NEOLIBERAL FUNCTION OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE WAS NOT A TOP-DOWN PROCESS BUT WAS CONSTITUTED THROUGH A FORM OF SOCIAL MOVEMENT WHOSE DOMINANT LIBERAL HUMAN RIGHTS DISCOURSE WAS (RE)PRODUCED BY THE STATE AS WELL AS BY GRASS-ROOTS MOVEMENTS INCLUDING THE MAFROUZEEN AMNIYA GROUP. IN ARGUING THIS, RATHER THAN PRESENT UNEMPLOYED PROTESTERS AS BEING CO-OPTED AND SUBORDINATED TO THE STATE, THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A NUANCED UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THEY CAN REPRODUCE AND AT THE SAME TIME CHALLENGE THE NEOLIBERAL TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE MOVEMENT.
364	THE SO-CALLED 'SECURITISATION' OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW IS LARGELY PREMISED AND ENACTED ON GROUNDS OF DEFENSIVE SECURITY EXCEPTIONS, WHEREBY GOVERNMENTS INVOKE THEIR NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS TO DEPART FROM THEIR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC OBLIGATIONS. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ONGOING DEBATE ON THE COMPATIBILITY OF SUCH SECURITY-DRIVEN UNILATERAL MEASURES WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW AND WITHIN THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE, BY EXPLORING WHETHER LEGAL PATTERNS TACKLING ESSENTIAL SECURITY INTERESTS UNDER INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW MAY REACH BEYOND STATE-CENTRED NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS TO ALSO ENCOMPASS CONCERNS ARISING FROM GLOBAL SECURITY THREATS (SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY). IN DOING SO, THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE RELEVANT APPROACHES TAKEN BY THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU), PARTICULARLY IN THE OPERATION OF THE FUNCTIONING OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE EU ENJOYS BROAD EXCLUSIVE COMPETENCE IN FRAMING AND IMPLEMENTING ITS TRADE AND INVESTMENT POLICY UNDER THE CCP, BOTH IN TERMS OF ITS INTERNAL REGULATION AND EXTERNAL ACTION. IN THIS CONTEXT, SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS ARE BOUND TO ARISE. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES A SERIES OF RELEVANT LEGAL INSTRUMENTS ORIGINATING FROM OR CONCLUDED BY THE EU, AND ANALYSES HOW THESE INCORPORATE SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS AND THE EU'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONCEPT OF SECURITY THEREUNDER. AFTER CONSIDERING SECURITY UNDER EU PRIMARY LAW, THE ARTICLE REVIEWS THE POSITION TAKEN BY THE EU AS A BILATERAL TREATY PLAYER, BY REFERENCE TO THE TRADE AND COMPREHENSIVE AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND AS A MEMBER OF THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, NOTABLY ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE SECURITY EXCEPTIONS CLAUSE. IT ALSO LOOKS INTO EU INTERNAL ACTION ON FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT SCREENING, EXPORT CONTROL AND FOREIGN SUBSIDIES REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS THE EU'S PROPOSED 'ANTI-COERCION MECHANISM' AND ITS 'GLOBAL HUMAN RIGHTS SANCTION REGIME'. THE ANALYSIS OF THE EU'S MULTIFACETED PRACTICE SHOWS THAT WHILE GLOBAL SECURITY CONCERNS MAY INCREASINGLY UNDERLIE OBLIGATIONS TO COOPERATE AND COORDINATION CLAUSES, EXISTENT SECURITY-RELATED LEGAL PATTERNS IN BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL TREATY PRACTICE REMAIN 'NATIONAL SECURITY'-CENTRED; AND DESPITE THE INCREASING 'ENLARGEMENT' OF THE SCOPE OF NATIONAL SECURITY TO ENCOMPASS ADDITIONAL NON-MILITARY THREATS, THE VAST ARRAY OF GLOBAL SECURITY THREATS AND VULNERABILITIES ARE HARDLY COVERED BY THIS EXPANSION.
365	THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT SOCIOPOLITICAL DESIGN OF MODERN RUSSIA IS STILL OBSOLETE AND IN MANY WAYS DOES NOT MEET THE MODERN CHALLENGES. THE RULING POLITICAL COALITION MAINTAINS CONTROL OVER ALL THE LEVERS OF POLITICAL POWER, USES THEM TO ACHIEVE ITS OWN INTERESTS, AND EXPANDS ITS COMPETENCE AS WIDELY AS POSSIBLE; IN SO DOING, IT FACES NO OPPOSITION FROM THE SOCIETY AND CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS TOOLS FOR EXERCISE OF POWER. THE ORIGINS OF MODERN RUSSIAN POLITICAL REGIME DERIVE FROM ARCHAIC BEHAVIOR PATTERNS THAT PREVAIL IN THE RUSSIAN POLITICAL CLASS' BEHAVIOR. THE OBSOLETE DESIGN OF RUSSIAN SOCIO-POLITICAL SYSTEM PRODUCES SERIOUS DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS AND SHOULD BE REPLACED BY A MODERN ONE. SUCH MODERNIZATION CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS. THE FIRST ONE IS TO DEVELOP THE DEMOCRATIC COMPONENT OF POLITICAL LIFE; THE SECOND ONE IS TO ESTABLISH POTENT LEGAL RESTRICTIONS ON THE AUTHORITY. THE FORMER WAY LEADS TO CHAOS AND COLLAPSE OF STATE, WHILE THE LATTER REQUIRES A CONSIDERABLE CHANGE IN THE BEHAVIOR PATTERNS OF RUSSIAN POLITICAL CLASS AND IS RATHER PROMISING IN THE LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT PERIOD.
366	A NATIONAL SECURITY EMERGENCY JUSTIFYING THE ELIMINATION OF FULL JUDICIAL REVIEW AND REMEDIES FOR EXECUTIVE ACTION IS OFTEN ANALYZED AS AN EXCEPTIONAL, DISTINCTIVE CHALLENGE TO THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, THE POSSIBILITY OF IRREPARABLE HARM FREQUENTLY SUPPORTS BYPASSING JUDICIAL PROCEDURES IN MORE PEDESTRIAN PEACETIME LAW, SUCH AS AN EXIGENT-CIRCUMSTANCES EXCEPTION TO THE FOURTH AMENDMENT'S WARRANT REQUIREMENT OR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION TO AVOID IRREPARABLE HARM BEFORE A TRIAL ON THE MERITS. WHILE THE SCALE MAY BE DIFFERENT IN NATIONAL SECURITY CRISES, THE PROBLEM IS THE SAME: HOW TO MAINTAIN THE RULE OF LAW WHEN THE TRADITIONAL PROCEDURES AND REMEDIAL DOCTRINES OF A REVIEWING INSTITUTION MAY BE ILL-SUITED FOR AVOIDING IRREPARABLE HARM IN THE TIME REQUIRED FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW. THIS NOTE USES THE IMMUNITY PROVISIONS OF THE HABEAS CORPUS ACT OF 1863-IN WHICH CONGRESS EXPLICITLY ELIMINATED LEGAL REMEDIES DURING THE GREATEST NATIONAL CRISIS OF AMERICAN HISTORY-TO ILLUMINATE THE BROADER PRINCIPLES BEHIND THE AVAILABILITY OF JUDICIAL REMEDIES IN EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES. IN "ROUTINE" EXIGENCIES, SUCH AS A REQUEST FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION OR EXCEPTIONS TO THE WARRANT REQUIREMENT, A SHORTCUT AROUND FULL PROCEDURE FOR THE DETERMINATION OF RIGHTS AND DUTIES IS PERMITTED SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF JUDICIAL REVIEW AFTER THE INTERVENTION, AND, OFTEN, COMPENSATION. THE IMMUNITY PROVISIONS OF THE HABEAS CORPUS ACT OF 1863 CUT OFF BOTH OF THESE REMEDIAL FUNCTIONS. SUCH IMMUNITIES DEFEAT THE COMPENSATION PURPOSE OF REMEDIES UNNECESSARILY; AS REMEDIES IN "ROUTINE" EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS DEMONSTRATE, THE COMPENSATION AND JUDICIAL REVIEW FUNCTIONS NEED NOT ALWAYS RESULT IN DETERRENCE OF EXECUTIVE ACTION IN A CRISIS. IMMUNITY PROVISIONS SUCH AS THOSE IN THE ACT ALSO HINDER THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LAW AND INCREASE UNCERTAINTY FOR FUTURE ACTORS AND THEIR POSSIBLE FUTURE VICTIMS, EVEN OUTSIDE EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. THIS NOTE ARGUES THAT THE BEST APPROACH TO JUDICIAL REVIEW IN NATIONAL SECURITY CRISES IS NOT TO ELIMINATE REMEDIES ENTIRELY, AS THE HABEAS CORPUS ACT ATTEMPTED TO DO, BUT TO "CODE-SWITCH" FROM A REGIME OF PROPERTY RULES TO A REGIME OF LIABILITY RULES IN ORDER TO PRESERVE VICTIM COMPENSATION AND THE RULE OF LAW.
367	THE DAYTON PEACE AGREEMENT (DPA) ENDED THE WAR IN BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA (B&H) AND CREATED A NEW CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER. THE VERY FIRST UNIQUE FEATURE OF DPA IS ITS 10TH ANNEX WHICH PROVIDES ONE PERSON (THE HIGH REPRESENTATIVE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN B&H) WITH ENORMOUS POWERS (LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL AND EXECUTIVE) WHICH IS GRANTED TO HIM BY THIS ANNEX. IN THIS RESPECT A NEW CONCEPT OF INTERVENTIONISM IS INTRODUCED TO JUSTIFY THE INVOLVEMENT OF EXTERNAL FACTORS IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF B&H. THE 'PRESCRIBED DAYTON DEMOCRACY' FROM OUTSIDE IS NOT REALLY A DEMOCRACY IN A FULL SENSE, BECAUSE IT HAS PUT THE WAR ELITES IN CHARGE, WITH A QUESTIONABLE LEGITIMACY, WHO ARE UNDER FOREIGN INFLUENCE. THE DPA FORMALISED AND EMPHASISED THIS CONCEPT OF 'ETHNICALISATION' OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM, BY PUTTING THE CONSTITUENT PEOPLES AT THE VERY CORE OF BOSNIAN STATEHOOD. THIS CONSTITUENT PEOPLE'S CONCEPT CREATED AN ETHNIC BASED POWER SHARING THAT DID NOT FUNCTION UNTIL TODAY. STATE-BUILDING IN B&H HAS BEEN DRASTICALLY SLOWED DOWN BY INTERNAL DISAGREEMENT, FOSTERED BY THE CONSOCIATAL MODEL OF DEMOCRACY. SUCH 'CONSTITUTIONAL AND DEMOCRACY MODEL' IMPACTS SIGNIFICANTLY THE STABILITY OF THE BOSNIAN STATE.
368	THE PRESENT ESSAY ESTABLISHES THE EXISTING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE POLITICAL CONSTITUTION OF 1991 AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, INCLUDING THE COMPLEMENTARITY THAT EXISTS BETWEEN RULES AND PRINCIPLES THAT HARMONIOUSLY PARTICIPATE IN THE DEFINITION OF THE SOCIAL STATE OF LAW AND THAT DERIVED FROM THE ABOVE THE SOCIAL PART IS MORE IMPORTANT, SUCH AS: HUMAN DIGNITY, RIGHTS AND CITIZEN GUARANTEES.
369	DURING MUCH OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, RIO DE JANEIRO, THE BRAZILIAN CAPITAL, WAS UNDER A SELECTIVE CURFEW THAT MADE IT A CRIME TO BE IN THE CITY'S PUBLIC SPACES AFTER DARK. THE CURFEW BENT NORMAL RULES AND ATTENUATED SUPPOSEDLY UNIVERSAL RIGHTS, OVERTLY DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF CLASS AND RACE. RULES THAT LEGALLY DEFINED THE NIGHTTIME DID NOT COME FROM ANY NATIONAL STATUTE, OR FROM NEWLY INDEPENDENT BRAZIL'S LIBERAL CONSTITUTION (1824) OR ITS CRIMINAL CODE (1830). INSTEAD, RIO'S NOCTURNAL SOCIOLEGAL WORLD WAS THE PRODUCT OF POLICE EDICTS, ON-THE-GROUND POLICING PRACTICE, AND CITY ORDINANCES. IT ALSO EMERGED FROM THE ACTIONS OF PEOPLE WHO USED THE DARKER HOURS FOR WORK, PLAY, AND RESISTANCE AGAINST OPPRESSION, ESPECIALLY MEMBERS OF THE CITY'S IMMENSE ENSLAVED POPULATION AND THE GROWING NUMBER OF FREE PERSONS OF AFRICAN DESCENT. IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS A PHENOMENON OF URBAN GOVERNANCE THAT ALLOWS, AND INDEED FORCES US TO LOOK BEYOND THE NINETEENTH-CENTURY NATION-STATE TO UNDERSTAND THE EXERCISE OF POWER AT A LOCAL LEVEL. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW THE CURFEW ESTABLISHED PATTERNS AND MEANS OF LIMITING THE BASIC FREEDOM TO MOVE ABOUT THE CITY. IT WAS AT NIGHT WHEN BOTH THE NECESSITY AND FRAGILITY OF WHAT JURISTS IN BRAZIL CALLED THE "FREEDOM TO COME AND GO" CAME INTO VIEW. THE DAILY TRANSITION BETWEEN DAY AND NIGHT ENACTED JURIDICAL CHANGES THAT, ALTHOUGH INVISIBLE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, FUNDAMENTALLY SHAPED THE SOCIAL CATEGORIES THAT DETERMINED PEOPLE'S PLACES IN SOCIETY IN WAYS THAT HISTORICAL RESEARCH HAS YET TO EXPLORE.
370	IN DRAWING FROM NEO-INSTITUTIONAL THEORY AND THE INSTITUTION-BASED VIEW, THIS STUDY PROVIDES NEW INSIGHTS CONCERNING HOW HOME AND HOST COUNTRY NORMS INFLUENCE WHOLLY OWNED FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY (WOFS) FORMAL CONTRACT UTILIZATION. OUR ANALYSIS OF 171 WOFSS OPERATING IN THE PHILIPPINES SUGGESTS THAT PARENT HOME COUNTRY UNCERTAINTY AVOIDANCE, AS AN INSTITUTIONALIZED ORGANIZATIONAL PRACTICE, IS POSITIVELY RELATED TO WOFS UTILIZATION OF FORMAL CONTRACTS IN GOVERNING INTERORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS. OUR RESULTS ALSO REVEAL THAT MANAGERIAL PERCEPTIONS OF LOCAL JUDICIAL ARBITRARINESS DIRECTLY INFLUENCE FORMAL CONTRACT UTILIZATION, AND MODERATE THE POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARENT HOME COUNTRY UNCERTAINTY AVOIDANCE AND WOFS FORMAL CONTRACT UTILIZATION. FURTHERMORE, WHEN COMPARED TO MANAGERIAL PERCEPTIONS OF NATIONAL JUDICIAL ARBITRARINESS, PERCEIVED LOCAL JUDICIAL ARBITRARINESS WILL EXHIBIT A STRONGER NEGATIVE DIRECT AND INDIRECT INFLUENCE ON WOFS FORMAL CONTRACT UTILIZATION. IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS ARE DISCUSSED.
371	THE ARTICLE EXAMINES RELATIONSHIP OF RUSSIAN SOCIETY- AND POLICE (MILITIA) AS A BODY INTENDED TO PROTECT THE RULE OF LAW. DURING DIFFERENT PERIODS OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE XIX-XXI CENTURY, ANALYZED THE INFLUENCE OF CINEMA ON THE FORMATION OF PUBLIC OPINION ON THE EVALUATION OF THE POLICE OFFICERS. AS EXAMPLES OF DIALOGS FROM MOVIES EXAMINES THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONFLICTS BETWEEN CITIZENS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.
372	CURRENT REFORMS OF THE GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACTS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE CAN BE SEEN AS INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE LEGALISTIC TRADITION AND POLITICAL AND MANAGERIAL PRESSURE ON THE RATIONALIZATION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. EIGHTY-YEAR TRADITION OF GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE IN THE REGION, ESPECIALLY ON THE TERRITORY OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA, IS AN OBSTACLE TO ADMINISTRATIVE MODERNISATION, BECAUSE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ARE FREQUENTLY USED FOR AND ABUSED IN VARIOUS BUREAUCRATIC MANOEUVRES. ALTHOUGH GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES CAN ENSURE BETTER LEGAL PROTECTION OF CITIZENS IF CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE FULFILLED, THEY SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR REDUCING THE COMPLEXITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS TO ROUTINE LEGALISTIC DECISION-MAKING. THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE CAN ADD SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF LEGAL PROTECTION OF CITIZENS, AND IT CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY ENSURE STREAMLINING, SIMPLIFICATION AND ACCELERATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES. SUCH MODERNISATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE CAN BE, IN THE NEXT STEP, ACCOMPANIED BY SIGNIFICANT MODERNISATION OF PUBLIC MANAGEMENT. HOWEVER, INSTEAD OF THE RADICAL NEW PUBLIC MANAGEMENT IDEAS, LEGALLY BOUNDED MANAGEMENT SEEMS TO BE THE PROPER SOLUTION.
373	THE FIRST PART, ON HUMAN RIGHTS GENERATIONS, ANALYZES THE HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF FREEDOMS. HUMAN RIGHTS WERE BORN WITHIN MODERNITY, WITH MARKED INDIVIDUALISTIC IMPRINT AS INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS THAT FORM THE FIRST PHASE OR GENERATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS INDIVIDUALISTIC IDEOLOGICAL MATRIX UNDERGO AN EXTENSIVE PROCESS OF EROSION AND CHALLENGE IN THE SOCIAL STRUGGLES OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. THESE PROTEST MOVEMENTS BECOME APPARENT THE NEED TO COMPLETE THE CATALOG OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF THE FIRST GENERATION WITH A SECOND GENERATION OF RIGHTS: ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS. THE PROTEST HUMAN RIGHTS STRATEGY IS PRESENTED TODAY WITH THE NOVEL UNEQUIVOCALLY POLARIZED AROUND ISSUES SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO PEACE, THE RIGHTS OF CONSUMERS, THE RIGHT TO QUALITY OF LIFE, LIBERTY OR COMPUTER FEATURES. BASED ON IT, IT OPENS UP, WITH INCREASING INTENSITY, THE CONVICTION THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH A THIRD GENERATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS COMPLEMENTS EARLIER STAGES. THE SECOND PART IS THE IMPACT OF TELEDEMOCRACY AND CYBER CITIZENSHIP IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS SPHERE. THE THEME OF GENERATIONS OF LAW EXTENDS A REFERENCE TO THE RIGHTS OF THIRD GENERATION NUCLEAR ASPECT: THE PROJECTION OF THE NT AND ICTS IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES (TELEDEMOCRACY) AND AS ONE OF THE MAIN ASPECTS OF THIS PHENOMENON, THE EXERCISE OF HUMAN RIGHTS OF POLITICAL PARTICIPATION THROUGH NEW TECHNOLOGICAL MEANS (CYBER CITIZENSHIP). WE STUDY HERE THE MAIN ADVANTAGES AND RISKS INVOLVED IN SUCH TECHNOLOGY PROJECTIONS IN THE EXERCISE OF HUMAN RIGHTS.
374	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE AMENDMENTS OF JANUARY 2018 TO THE ACT ON THE INSTITUTE OF NATIONAL REMEMBRANCE (INR) OF 1998, WHICH HAS RAISED DOUBTS IN LIGHT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND PROVOKED DIPLOMATIC TENSIONS BETWEEN POLAND ON ONE SIDE AND GERMANY UKRAINE, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND ISRAEL ON THE OTHER. THE INR IS A NATIONAL INSTITUTION WHOSE ROLE IS, AMONG OTHERS, TO PROSECUTE PERPETRATORS OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMES COMMITTED BETWEEN 1917-1990. THE ARTICLE PROVES THAT THE WORDING OF THE AMENDMENTS IS INCONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW, AS IT IGNORES THE PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY, DEFINITIONS OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMES, AND DISPROPORTIONATELY LIMITS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. IN CONSEQUENCE, IT CANNOT BE EXPECTED THAT THIRD STATES WILL COOPERATE WITH POLAND IN THE EXECUTION OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR VIOLATION OF THE NEWLY ADOPTED NORMS.
375	THIS ARTICLE COMMENCES WITH A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON STATE AND ECONOMY IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT A CHARACTERISATION OF THE NATURE OF A CONSTITUTIONAL STATE, IN TERMS OF THE DIFFERENTLY-NATURED LEGAL SPHERES WITHIN A DIFFERENTIATED SOCIETY. THE FOCUS THEN SHIFTS TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, THE PROBLEM OF POVERTY AND THE RELEVANCE OF VARIOUS THEORIES OF DEVELOPMENT. A LITERATURE REVIEW REVEALS AS ALTERNATIVE THEORIES FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH THE LINEAR-STAGES-GROWTH MODEL, THE NEO-MARXIST (OR DEPENDENCY) GROWTH MODEL, THE ORTHODOX GROWTH MODEL AND THE STRUCTURAL GROWTH THEORY. THE SINGLE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF ALL THESE MODELS IS THE QUICKEST ERADICATION OF POVERTY, BUT THESE THEORIES DIFFER WITH REGARD TO THE MOST SUITABLE WAYS IN WHICH TO ERADICATE POVERTY ON A SUSTAINED BASIS IN THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME. LITERATURE ON DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES CURRENTLY FAVOURS EITHER THE ORTHODOX MODEL OR THE STRUCTURAL MODEL, AS THE OTHER TWO MODELS HAVE BEEN DISCREDITED OWING TO RECENT EXPERIENCES IN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. THIS CHALLENGE OF POVERTY ERADICATION HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS ONE OF MELTING THE "GOLDEN CURTAIN WHICH SEPARATES WEALTHY COUNTRIES IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE FROM THE POOR COUNTRIES IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE. ALTHOUGH DIFFERENT MODELS AIMING AT ECONOMIC GROWTH AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WERE USED BY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND IN DIFFERENT REGIONS, AFRICAN COUNTRIES HAVE SHOWN LITTLE PROGRESS IN THE ERADICATION OF POVERTY. FACTORS OTHER THAN THE APPLICATION OF PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES THEREFORE PLAYED A ROLE AND CONTRIBUTED, DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES, EITHER TO A FASTER OR TO A SLOWER ERADICATION OF POVERTY IN DIFFERENT REGIONS AND COUNTRIES. THESE DISCREPANCIES THAT OCCURRED OVER A PERIOD OF 30 YEARS (1970 TO 2000) BETWEEN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD RECORDING REMARKABLE PROGRESS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO COMBAT POVERTY ON THE ONE HAND, COMPARED TO INCREASES IN POVERTY IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD ON THE OTHER, REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT A MORE ENCOMPASSING PERSPECTIVE. ON THE BASIS OF THESE CONSIDERATIONS THE QUESTION IS THEN RAISED IN THIS PAPER AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE "JUST STATE" CAN PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, INTER ALIA, IN THE LIGHT OF EXISTING THEORIES OF DEVELOPMENT. THE INTIMATE COHERENCE BETWEEN A SYSTEM OF FREE ENTERPRISE, THE FREE MARKET AND THE JURIDICAL GUARANTEES OF A JUST STATE UNDERPINS KEY ELEMENTS IN THE FORMULATION OF THE CONCLUSION OF THIS ARTICLE.
376	TODAY'S CENTRAL BANKS WIELD EXTRAORDINARY POWERS, BOTH MONETARY AND REGULATORY, AND WITH A CAPACITY TO SUBSTITUTE FOR ELECTED GOVERNMENTS TEMPTED TO PASS THE BUCK. DEBATES ABOUT CENTRAL BANKING'S POWERS AND LEGITIMACY BARELY TOUCH, HOWEVER, ON WHETHER AND HOW MONETARY INDEPENDENCE FITS WITH THE VALUES THAT DRIVE CONSTITUTIONALISM. IT TURNS OUT THAT, FOR MODERN ECONOMIES USING FIAT MONEY, INDEPENDENCE IS A COROLLARY OF THE HIGHER LEVEL SEPARATION OF (FISCAL) POWERS BETWEEN THE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE BRANCHES. EVEN THOUGH INDEPENDENCE IS NECESSARY, IT NEEDS TO BE CAREFULLY CONSTRAINED BY A "MONEY-CREDIT CONSTITUTION." THOSE GENERAL ARGUMENTS, APPLICABLE IN LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES, DO NOT CARRY ACROSS CLEANLY TO THE EURO AREA. A PRINCIPLED CASE CAN BE MADE FOR THE ECB'S MANDATE BEING SPECIALLY TIGHT, BUT THAT IS IN TENSION WITH ITS DE FACTO ROLE AS THE EMERGENCY ECONOMIC ACTOR FOR THE EURO AREA. FACING UP TO THAT WILL BE NECESSARY SOONER OR LATER.
377	THE ARTICLE PROVIDES THE RESULTS OF ENQUIRY INTO B. I. KHARITON'S INITIAL PERIOD OF WORK AS A JOURNALIST IN THE NEWSPAPERS "ODESSKIE NOVOSTI" AND "IUZHNYI KURIER". THE PAPER DEALS WITH B. I. KHARITON'S WRITING, HIS STYLE AND THE MULTIFORM GENRES OF HIS PUBLICATIONS THAT AIMED TO DEFEND THE OPPRESSED PEOPLE, ENHANCE PUBLIC MORALS, BOLSTER CULTURE, EDUCATION, AND THE RULE OF LAW. REFS 19.
378	CURRENTLY THERE IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER AND HOW AFGHANISTAN SHOULD ENGAGE NON-STATE COUNCILS OF ELDERS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. IN ORDER TO HARNESS THEIR BENEFITS (E.G. EFFICIENCY), CONTROL THEIR ABUSES (E.G. OCCASIONAL CONTROVERSIAL RESOLUTIONS), AND STABILIZE THE RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES, SOME HAVE ARGUED THAT FORMAL LINKS SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE STATE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND NON-STATE COUNCILS OF ELDERS IN AFGHANISTAN. OTHERS ARGUE THAT MERE INFORMAL LINKS BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED. STILL OTHERS SUGGEST THAT PRIOR MODELS OF STATE ENGAGEMENT IN AFGHANISTAN SHOULD BE REVIVED. IN KYRGYZSTAN, JUST 65 MILES NORTH OF AFGHANISTAN, THE TSARIST, SOVIET AND POST-SOVIET ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE USED VARIOUS METHODS TO ENGAGE NON-STATE COUNCILS OF ELDERS. DESPITE THESE VASTLY DIFFERENT ATTEMPTS AT CONTROLLING LOCAL DISPUTE RESOLUTIONS, ELDERS INDEPENDENTLY RESOLVED DISPUTES OUTSIDE OF TSARIST AND SOVIET CONTROL AND CONTINUE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES OUTSIDE OF POST-SOVIET STATE CONTROL IN KYRGYZSTAN. THIS PHENOMENON HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR LEGITIMACY IN ANY MODELS OF STATE ENGAGEMENT THAT ARE CONSIDERED FOR AFGHANISTAN. IF, AS OBSERVED IN KYRGYZSTAN, PEOPLE DO NOT USE STATE-SANCTIONED LOCAL COUNCILS IN AFGHANISTAN, THEN THEIR PURPOSES MAY BE FRUSTRATED. THEREFORE, IN ADDITION TO REVIEWING THE EXPERIENCE WITH STATE ENGAGEMENT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD, POLICY MAKERS IN AFGHANISTAN SHOULD ALSO REVIEW THE HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY EXPERIENCE WITH STATE ENGAGEMENT IN KYRGYZSTAN. AS THE NEED FOR LEGITIMACY IS RECONSIDERED AND APPLIED TO THE DESIGN OF MODELS FOR AFGHANISTAN, IT MAY BE MORE LIKELY THAT THOSE MODELS WILL BE USED BY MORE PEOPLE IN AFGHANISTAN AND THAT THEIR PURPOSES WILL BE FURTHERED.
379	THE EUROPEAN UNION IS AN OPEN MEMBERSHIP ORGANISATION; ANY COUNTRY IN EUROPE CAN JOIN PROVIDED IT MEETS THE MEMBERSHIP STANDARDS. POST-COMMUNIST COUNTRIES ARE KEEN TO JOIN, FOR DOING SO IS INTEGRAL TO THE 'RETURN TO EUROPE'. BUT DO THE TEN POST-COMMUNIST COUNTRIES SEEKING MEMBERSHIP MEET THE STANDARDS OF THE UNION, THAT IS, ARE THEY COMMITTED TO DEMOCRACY, A MARKET ECONOMY AND THE RULE OF LAW?
380	RESEARCH ON THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONS ON VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS HAS REVEALED A PUZZLING PICTURE. WHILE INSTITUTIONAL THEORY PREDICTS THAT HIGHER DEVELOPED INSTITUTIONS SHOULD PROMOTE INVESTMENTS, THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IS SURPRISINGLY AMBIGUOUS. THIS STUDY CONNECTS THE INSTITUTION-BASED VIEW AND THE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTORS BY EXAMINING THE DISTINCT EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTH AND INSTITUTIONAL STABILITY ON VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. EMPIRICAL RESULTS FROM 58,062 INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES, NESTED IN 104 COUNTRIES, SHOW THAT VENTURES ATTRACT HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTH BUT LOWER INSTITUTIONAL STABILITY. HOWEVER, BOTH INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTH AND INSTITUTIONAL STABILITY INCREASE THE SURVIVABILITY OF THOSE FUNDED VENTURES. HENCE, WE PROMOTE A DYNAMIC PERSPECTIVE ON INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTS FOR FOUNDERS, INVESTORS, AND POLICY-MAKERS, SINCE THESE INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTS DIFFER BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTH AND STABILITY AS WELL AS BETWEEN DIFFERENT FIRM CHARACTERISTICS, STRATEGIES, AND PERFORMANCE DIMENSIONS.
381	THE PRESENT WORK ANALYSES SOME ASSOCIATION AGREEMENTS BETWEEN LATIN AMERICA AND EUROPE, WHICH DEFEND AND PROMOTE A POLITICAL DIALOGUE BASED ON SHARED VALUES IN BOTH REGIONS SUCH AS THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, EQUALITY, DEMOCRATIC VALUES OR SECURITY, AMONG OTHERS. IN THIS MANNER, THE BI-REGIONAL STRATEGIC ASSOCIATION EU-LAC GOES BEYOND ECONOMIC PROGRESS AND PROVIDES A WELL-STABLISHED RULE OF LAW BASED ON A COMMON CULTURE.
382	AMONG THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF MICHAEL TREBILCOCK'S MANY EXCEPTIONAL SCHOLARLY CONTRIBUTIONS HAS BEEN THE IMPACT OF HIS WORK ON THE FIELD OF LAW AND DEVELOPMENT. AT THE CORE OF THE DEVELOPMENT ENTERPRISE LIES A CENTRAL CONUNDRUM-WHY DO OBVIOUSLY DESIRABLE INSTITUTIONAL OUTCOMES NOT TRANSPIRE IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD?-AND TREBILCOCK HAS PROVIDED INVALUABLE INSIGHTS INTO HOW VARIOUS HISTORIC, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL FORCES MAY PROMOTE, SHAPE, OR INHIBIT SUCH SALUTARY CHANGE. TAKING TREBILCOCK'S EXISTING CORPUS OF WORK AS A STARTING POINT, WE OUTLINE A PROPOSED RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS OF LAW AND DEVELOPMENT SCHOLARSHIP, HIGHLIGHTING OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS THAT SURROUND THE SEQUENCING OF REFORMS; THE ROLE OF PATH DEPENDENCE; THE INTERACTION OF LAW, CULTURE, AND INSTITUTIONS; AND, FINALLY, THE ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN ADDRESSING THE DILEMMAS OF DEVELOPMENT.
383	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE STUDY OF THE PECULIARITIES OF PERCEPTION AND UNDERSTANDING BY MEDIEVAL PHILOSOPHERS AND LAWYERS OF THE BASIC LEGAL CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS, FEATURES OF THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONING OF THE MEDIEVAL LEGAL SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. THE CONCEPTS OF "LAW" (IUS) AND "LEGISLATION" (LEX), AS WELL AS RELATED CATEGORIES OF "JUSTICE", "EQUALITY", "DUTY" ARE CONSIDERED. THE AUTHORS BELIEVE THAT LEGAL PARTICULARISM PROVIDED ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PROTECTION OF SUBJECTIVE RIGHTS, STIMULATED COMPETITION BETWEEN LEGAL SYSTEMS AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE FORMATION OF LAW AS AN AUTHORITATIVE AND INFLUENTIAL SOCIAL REGULATOR.
384	IN THIS PAPER I EXAMINE CONVERGENT AND DIVERGENT PERSPECTIVES ON JUSTICE AND THEIR RELATION TO CULPABILITY. TWO CULTURALLY DISTINCT JUDICIAL SYSTEMS SERVE AS THE FOCUS, THE AMERICAN RULE OF LAW, AND SAUDI ARABIAN LEGAL PROCEDURES. I STUDIED CULTURAL AND LEGAL DIFFERENCES BY EXAMINING THE INSANITY DEFENSE AND HOW IT IS PERCEIVED AND PRACTICED IN BOTH AMERICAN AND SAUDI ARABIAN SOCIETIES, ACCORDING TO THE PREVAILING CONTEMPORARY LEGAL SYSTEMS.
385	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE POSITIONING, IN FRANCE, OF THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM, AN AREA THAT FALLS PRIMARILY UNDER THE REMIT OF NATIONAL DEFENSE. THIS SITUATION IS NOT COMMENSURATE WITH THE NEED, IN LINE WITH THE VALUES OF DEMOCRACY AND THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW, TO CONSIDER TERRORISM AS A PARTICULAR FORM OF CRIME CONNECTED WITH THE FIELD OF POLICING AND PUBLIC SAFETY.
386	I AM MOST GRATEFUL TO SAMANTHA BESSON, DAVID DYZENHAUS, THOMAS POOLE, AND ALEXANDER SOMEK FOR THEIR INTEREST IN MY ARTICLE 'ARE SOVEREIGNS ENTITLED TO THE RULE OF LAW?' AND FOR THEIR INSIGHTS, CRITICISMS, AND SUGGESTIONS. I AM PARTICULARLY GRATEFUL TO THEM FOR SEEING AND UNDERSTANDING THE KIND OF REORIENTATION I WANTED TO SUGGEST. I SHALL SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR SPECIFIC CRITICISMS SHORTLY. BUT FIRST, SOME GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.
387	THE RULE OF LAW IN THE EUROPEAN UNION RESTS ON A PRECARIOUS DECENTRALISED JUDICIAL ARCHITECTURE WITH THE TWO PILLARS OF THE JUDICATURES OF THE EU AND OF THE MEMBER STATES. JUDICIAL PROTECTION EMERGES AS THE META-NORM FOR THE GOVERNANCE OF THIS COMPLEX GOVERNANCE SCHEME. IT RE-ORIENTATES THE ENTIRE EU JUDICIAL ARCHITECTURE TOWARDS PROTECTING INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS GROUNDED IN EU LAW. THE ARTICLE MAKES THREE SUPPORTING ARGUMENTS: FIRST, THE NORM OF JUDICIAL PROTECTION HAS BECOME INSTITUTIONALISED IN LAW, THROUGH THE CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION AND RELATING JURISPRUDENCE OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (THE COURT). FURTHER, AS JUDICIAL PROTECTION BECOMES A META-NORM, CAPABLE OF OVERRIDING EVEN CONFLICTING PRIMARY EU LAW THAT WOULD PRESERVE THE DISCRETION OF THE POLITICAL EU INSTITUTIONS OR THE PROCEDURAL AUTONOMY OF THE MEMBER STATES. FINALLY, BY REFERENCE TO THE NORM OF JUDICIAL PROTECTION, THE COURT'S DOCTRINE HAS BEEN SHAPING A SINGLE CODE OF PROCEDURE THAT WELDS THE ENTIRE TWIN-PILLARED EU JUDICIAL ARCHITECTURE INTO A COHERENT WHOLE. THE ARTICLE DOCUMENTS THIS SINGLE CODE OF PROCEDURE FOR A HORIZONTAL DIMENSION OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EU AND A VERTICAL DIMENSION OF THE MEMBER STATES COURTS. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS RISE OF JUDICIAL PROTECTION TO META-NORM APPLIES TO A WIDE VARIETY OF DEBATES ON THE JUDICIAL ARCHITECTURE, RANGING FROM A EU FEDERAL QUESTION JURISDICTION OF MEMBER STATES COURTS, ENFORCEMENT OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY IN THE SOVEREIGN MEMBER STATES, TO THE INTEGRATION OF INTERNATIONAL AND THIRD-COUNTRY COURTS. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THE ULTIMATE LEGITIMACY OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION DEPENDS ON RIGHTS BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY THROUGH THEIR GUARANTEED JUDICIAL PROTECTION.
388	A DOUBLE STANDARD IN BRIBERY LAW HAS EMERGED. OVER THE PAST DECADE, THE SUPREME COURT HAS BROKEN WITH A CENTURY OF PROGRESSIVE REFORMS BY NARROWLY INTERPRETING DOMESTIC BRIBERY AND OTHER CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST LAWS. THIS WEAK FEDERAL DOMESTIC BRIBERY LAW NOW STANDS IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE ROBUST AND EXPANSIVE PROSECUTIONS OF BRIBERY UNDER THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT (FCPA), WHICH LIMITS THE ABILITY OF U.S. ENTITIES TO BRIBE FOREIGN PUBLIC OFFICIALS. AS A RESULT OF THIS DOUBLE STANDARD, THOSE WHO SEEK TO IMPROPERLY INFLUENCE DOMESTIC PUBLIC OFFICIALS ARE OFTEN ABLE TO ENGAGE IN BEHAVIOR THAT LOOKS AND SMELLS LIKE BRIBERY BUT IS NOT BRIBERY. SIMILAR BEHAVIOR IN THE FOREIGN CONTEXT, HOWEVER, IS PUNISHED BY THE FCPA. THE ACT OF BRIBERY, WHETHER FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC, NOT ONLY UNDERMINES THE PRACTICE OF GOOD GOVERNANCE BUT ALSO DELEGITIMIZES GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS THEMSELVES. FEDERAL BRIBERY LAWS WERE TRADITIONALLY DESIGNED AND INTERPRETED TO ADDRESS BOTH OF THESE CONCERNS, EVOLVING INTO POWERFUL TOOLS OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT THE SUPREME COURT HAS RESTRICTED THE INTERPRETATION OF FEDERAL BRIBERY LAWS IN WAYS THAT HAVE WEAKENED THE DOMESTIC ANTIBRIBERY REGIME. AS A RESULT, HIGH-PROFILE ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE ABLE TO AVOID PUNISHMENT FOR ACTS THAT WOULD HAVE, UNTIL RECENTLY, BEEN CONSIDERED ILLEGAL. IN CONTRAST, THE FCPA HAS NOT ONLY WITHSTOOD LEGAL CHALLENGES, BUT IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED AS A POWERFUL TOOL FOR CURBING CORRUPTION. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THIS DIVERGENCE, ARGUES THAT THE DOMESTIC BRIBERY LAW SHOULD BE MODIFIED, AND IDENTIFIES TWO ASPECTS OF THE FCPA AS A MODEL FOR DOMESTIC STATUTORY REFORM.
389	IN MANY WAYS, WRITING ABOUT THE ECONOMIC CRISIS IN THE UK IS TELLING A STORY ABOUT THE PAST. RECENTLY, MEDIA AND SCHOLARS HAVE BEEN REPORTING THAT A SUCCESSFUL ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS UPON US, THAT THE DOUBLE DIP RECESSION IS OVER AND THAT A SLOW BUT STEADY EXPANSION OF THE UK ECONOMY IS ALREADY TAKING PLACE. TO PUT IT SIMPLY, THE UK APPEARS TO BE OUT OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS. YET, ALTHOUGH THE ECONOMY HAS IMPROVED, THE POLITICS OF THE CURRENT CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT IS STILL VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON LIMITING SOCIAL BENEFITS AND ENTITLEMENTS, A MOVE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED DURING THE ECONOMIC CRISIS, BUT ONE THAT IS NOW QUESTIONABLE. IN THIS REGARD, ALTHOUGH THIS ARTICLE APPEARS TO BE ABOUT THE PAST, IT IS IN FACT ABOUT THE PRESENT IT IS ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS, ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S TREATMENT OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE BOTH DURING AND OUT OF A RECESSION, AND ABOUT OUR CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE HOW THE ADOPTION OF A RIGHTS BASED APPROACH HAS ALREADY CHANGED THE TREATMENT OF AUSTERITY CLAIMS IN THE UK. RECENT CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UK (INCLUDING THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE REPEAL OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT AND THE ADOPTION OF A NEW BILL OF RIGHTS) AND THE DANGER OF WITHDRAWING FROM THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS MAKE THE FOCUS ON THIS JURISDICTION ESPECIALLY INTERESTING. THE OBVIOUS QUESTION THAT ARISES IS WHETHER A HUMAN RIGHTS BASED APPROACH IS DEPENDENT ON THE UK BEING A MEMBER OF THE CONVENTION. THE ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT ON THE CURRENT ENGLISH CONSTITUTIONAL CLIMATE AND REVEALS THE EXPANDED POTENTIAL FOR RIGHTS PROTECTION.
390	THIS ARTICLE RAISES CERTAIN CLASSIC CONSIDERATIONS THAT SAINT THOMAS AQUINAS FORMULATED ABOUT THE GROUNDING OF LAW AS THE PRODUCT OF REASON AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LAWS OF MEN. THE ROLE OF SYNDERESIS AS A LINK BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE IUS NATURAE IS ANALIZED, AND IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE GOOD LIFE HAS ITS REFERENT IN "THE RULE OF LAW" AND IN THE PRACTICE OF THE MORAL VIRTUES.
391	ALTHOUGH MISDEMEANORS HAVE DIFFERENT FEATURES THAN CRIMES AS WELL AS ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS THAN CIVIL PUNISHMENTS, IT IS A NECESSITY TO VALIDATE THE PRINCIPLE THAT STATES THE LEGALITY OF BOTH CRIMES AND PUNISHMENTS, WHICH IS ONE OF THE BASIC PRINCIPALS OF CRIMINAL LAW AND ALSO A UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE OF LAW, FOR MISDEMEANORS IN ORDER TO ACTUALIZE THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS ELEMENTS, LEGAL CERTAINTY AND PREDICTABILITY OF THE LAW.
392	UNLIKE CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT SIZE HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED IN THE PHILIPPINES DESPITE NUMEROUS LITERATURE SUGGESTING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO. THIS STUDY FILLS THAT GAP BY LOOKING AT STATE SPENDING AND HOW IT RELATES TO THE ENDURING POLITICAL ISSUE OF PUBLIC CORRUPTION. FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT, CONTRARY TO EXPECTATIONS, BIGGER DISBURSEMENTS ACTUALLY IMPROVE PUBLIC'S PERCEPTION OF BUREAUCRATIC CORRUPTION, SIMILAR TO THE EFFECT OF BETTER INSTITUTIONS AND RULE OF LAW.
393	LAICITY (OR SECULARISM) EMBODIES AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT OF THE CITIZENSHIP. NONETHELESS, AND BECAUSE OF THIS RELEVANCE, DIFFERENT SOCIAL AND POLITICAL FORCES CONSTANTLY CRITICIZE IT. IN THIS ARTICLE, THE AUTHOR IDENTIFIES FOUR ENEMIES: CLERICALISM, RELIGIOUS FUNDAMENTALISMS, COMMUNITARIANISM, AND LAICISM. THE AIM IS NOT ONLY TO DENOUNCE THOSE ENEMIES BUT ALSO TO PROVIDE SOME ARGUMENTS AGAINST THEIR ATTACKS TO THE PRINCIPLE OF LAICITY.
394	WHO ARE THE PEOPLE? THE QUESTION ENTAILS TWO MAIN COMPETING APPROACHES, NAMELY A LIBERAL AND A POPULIST ONE. THIS PAPER PROVIDES A NORMATIVE DISCUSSION OF THE RATIONALES BEHIND BOTH APPROACHES; HOWEVER, A LIBERAL POSITION IS DEFENDED OVER THE POPULIST ONE BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS THAT POPULISM TENDS TO HAVE ON CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS OF A DEMOCRACY, I.E., SEPARATION OF POWERS, CHECKS AND BALANCES, AND THE RULE OF LAW.
395	TRADE BETWEEN GERMANY AND CENTRAL ASIA HAS INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS. THE REGION IS ATTRACTIVE TO GERMAN COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY AS A SOURCE OF RAW MATERIALS AND AS A GROWING MARKET FOR GERMAN GOODS. KAZAKHSTAN IS GERMANY'S MAIN TRADING PARTNER IN CENTRAL ASIA. IN ORDER TO TAP THIS POTENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION, POLITICAL STABILITY, INVESTMENT SECURITY, TRANSPARENCY AND RULE OF LAW ARE NEEDED IN THE REGION.
396	THERE ARE MANY DISCIPLINES AND PROFESSIONS IN WHICH THE ABILITY TO USE AND MANIPULATE LANGUAGE IS IMPORTANT. HOWEVER, IN LAW, LANGUAGE IS THE DISCIPLINE AND THE PROFESSION, AND WORDS ARE A LAWYER'S ONLY TOOLS OF TRADE. THIS MEANS THAT LAW SCHOOLS MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY TO EFFECTIVELY SUPPORT AND DEVELOP THEIR STUDENTS' WRITING SKILLS. THIS STUDY FOUND THAT, WHILST ACADEMICS IN AUSTRALIAN LAW SCHOOLS APPRECIATE THAT THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DEVELOP THEIR STUDENTS' WRITING, THEY ARE RELUCTANT TO RELY ON THE EXPERTS IN THEIR INSTITUTIONS WHO WOULD BEST BE ABLE TO ASSIST THEM WITH THIS: ACADEMIC LANGUAGE AND LEARNING (ALL) EXPERTS. THERE IS A PERCEPTION THAT LAW ACADEMICS DID NOT NEED TO RELY ON ALL EXPERTISE; THEY ARE AWARE THAT SUCH EXPERTISE EXISTS BUT DO NOT ACCESS IT AND MIGHT EVEN BE "EMBARRASSED" TO DO SO. OTHER STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THESE VIEWS ARE COMMONLY ENCOUNTERED BY ALL EXPERTS IN HIGHER EDUCATION. HOWEVER, THESE VIEWS ARE PARTICULARLY CONCERNING WHEN EXPRESSED BY ACADEMICS IN THE DISCIPLINE OF LAW, WHERE LANGUAGE IS THE DISCIPLINE. ADDITIONALLY, THE VIEWS EXPRESSED BY LAW ACADEMICS THAT THE "ROLLS ROYCE" OF ALL EXPERT WAS ONE WITH A LEGAL BACKGROUND FUNDAMENTALLY MISCONCEIVES THE ROLE OF ALL EXPERTISE AND SHOULD BE CHALLENGED. GIVEN THESE ATTITUDES, THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH SOME REFLECTIONS ABOUT HOW ALL EXPERTS MIGHT FIND WAYS "IN" TO COLLABORATE WITH LAW ACADEMICS.
397	THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES A SINGLE ISSUE BUT STILL UNRESOLVED CONCERNING THE RETROACTIVITY OF THE EFFECTS OF THE JUDICIAL PRECEDENT THAT APPLIES A NEW INTERPRETATION TO SOLVE CONTROVERSIAL CASES IN THE SUPERIOR COURTS OF JUSTICE. IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM THAT PROTECTS LEGAL CERTAINTY IT'S NECESSARY TO SET SOME BARRIERS AMONG THE RETROACTIVITY OF THE PRECEDENT THAT REQUIRES A NEW WAY OF BEHAVIOR AND THEREFORE BUILDS NEW RULE OF LAW.
398	THE STATE BASED ON LAW IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE SUPERIORITY OF THE JUSTICE OVER THE POLICE. WE CAN NOW OBSERVE THE CONSTRUCTION OF A EUROPEAN POLICE SYSTEM WHICH IS TENDING TO MAKE JUSTICE LESS IMPORTANT THAN POLICE CONTROL. THIS MEANS IN FACT THE END OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS MEANS ALSO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A RELATIVELY AUTONOMOUS PRIVATE SPHERE SEPARATED FROM THE ORGANIZATION OF THE PUBLIC LIFE.

400	THIS PAPER EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATES THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS, INCOME INEQUALITY, CULTURAL DIFFERENCES AND HEALTH EXPENDITURES ON CADAVERIC VERSUS TOTAL KIDNEY TRANSPLANTS SCRUTINIZING INFORMATION GATHERED FROM 63 COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 1998-2002. WE SHOW THAT IMPROVEMENTS IN INCOME EQUALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW ENCOURAGE CADAVERIC KIDNEY TRANSPLANTS IN LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES. WE FIND THAT CULTURAL DIFFERENCES AFFECT THE NUMBER OF CADAVERIC KIDNEY TRANSPLANTS BOTH IN LOW- AND HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES.
401	WE INTEND TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT DEBATE ABOUT THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF THE GLOBALIZATION PROCESS IN DEMOCRACY, AND SPECIFICALLY ON HUMAN RIGHTS, FIRSTLY BY A COLLISION AND VALUATION THEORETICAL AND ACADEMIC, THEN ANALYZING THE VENEZUELAN REALITY, IN WHICH THE PROGRESS AND PROGRESSIVENESS OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN TERMS OF THE BOLIVARIAN CONSTITUTION OF VENEZUELA IN 1999 DOES NOT CORRESPOND WITH THE STARK REALITY AND VIOLATION OF THE RULE OF LAW.
402	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS WERE BUILT PARALLEL TO DEMOCRACY, CONSTITUTIONALISM THROUGH THE PROCESS, GIVING RISE TO THE EMERGENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. LABOR RIGHTS WERE CREATED DURING THE WELFARE STATE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, THE WORKING CLASS AND PROFFER AN IMPROVED SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, WEALTH DISTRIBUTION AND SOCIAL INCLUSION, AND THEREFORE MUST BE MET, OTHERWISE JEOPARDIZE EVEN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DEMOCRATIC STATE.
403	IN THIS ARTICLE, DAVID ROSENBLOOM SUGGESTS FIVE LIMITATIONS OF THE 2004 J-PAE SYMPOSIUM ON SOCIAL EQUITY IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS EDUCATION. HE OFFERS FIVE INJUNCTIONS, PARALLELING THOSE LIMITATIONS, TO GUIDE DISCUSSION: DON'T FORGET THE RULE OF LAW; DEFINE SOCIAL EQUITY; CONFRONT THE INEQUITIES OF SOCIAL EQUITY; EXPLAIN THE ADVANTAGES, IF ANY, OF APPLYING THE TERM SOCIAL EQUITY TO STANDARD, LONGSTANDING SUBJECT MATTER IN MPA EDUCATION; AND AVOID STEALING POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY.
404	THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE DYNAMICS BETWEEN DISAGGREGATED FACTORS OF GOVERNANCE AND STOCK MARKET DEVELOPMENT FOR THE PANEL OF SELECTED SOUTH ASIAN COUNTRIES (I.E., BANGLADESH, INDIA, PAKISTAN AND SRI LANKA). USING NEWLY DEVELOPED DATA FOR DISAGGREGATES OF GOVERNANCE WITH ANNUAL FREQUENCY BETWEEN 1996 AND 2014, THIS STUDY PIONEERS IN SOUTH ASIAN CONTEXT. DOING SO, THIS STUDY INCORPORATES DYNAMIC PANEL DATA TECHNIQUE POOL MEAN GROUP ESTIMATION FOR ROBUST AND POLICY ORIENTED OUTCOMES. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THREE INDICATORS OF GOVERNANCE (CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, ACCOUNTABILITY AND RULE OF LAW) HAVE A POSITIVE AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON STOCK MARKET DEVELOPMENT. THE RESULTS OF LONG-RUN ESTIMATIONS ARE HOMOGENOUS ACROSS THE COUNTRIES BUT, THE SHORT-RUN ESTIMATES, AND THE SPEED OF ADJUSTMENT TOWARDS THE LONG-RUN EQUILIBRIUM ARE FOUND TO BE HETEROGENEOUS. IT COULD BE DUE TO VOLATILITY EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE IN EACH CROSS SECTION COUNTRY. FROM THE POLICY PERSPECTIVE, THE STUDY CONCLUDES THAT THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND GOVERNANCE ARE THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS ON MARKET CAPITALIZATION IN THE PANEL COUNTRIES. THE INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS (I.E., CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, ACCOUNTABILITY AND RULE OF LAW) SUPPORT STOCK MARKET DEVELOPMENT THROUGH HIGH MARKET CAPITALIZATION, STRENGTHENS INVESTOR'S CONFIDENCE FOR LONG TERM INVESTMENT IN THE COUNTRIES.
405	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE ROLE OF INFLATION TARGETING AS A PRICE SIGNALING MECHANISM REDUCING PRICE INFORMATION ASYMMETRY AND POTENTIALLY REDUCING INCENTIVES FOR CORRUPTIVE ACTIONS THROUGH ITS DIRECT CONTROL ON THE INFLATION RATE, THUS SIMULTANEOUSLY INCREASING INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. THE OBTAINED EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT ADOPTING INFLATION TARGETING LOWERS CORRUPTION IN A SAMPLE OF 61 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD BETWEEN 1990 AND 2018. COUNTRIES THAT HAVE ADOPTED INFLATION TARGETING EXPERIENCE LOWER CORRUPTION LEVELS, AS MEASURED BY THE CORRUPTION PERCEPTIONS (CP) INDEX, CONTROLLING FOR OTHER RELEVANT DETERMINANTS OF CORRUPTION IDENTIFIED IN THE EMPIRICAL LITERATURE, SUCH AS INFLATION, LEVEL OF INCOME, INCOME DISTRIBUTION, TRADE OPENNESS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS RESULT IS SENSITIVE TO THE TYPE OF INFLATION TARGETING ADOPTED. SOFT (UNOFFICIAL) INFLATION TARGETING HAS NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE CORRUPTION LEVEL, GIVING SUPPORT TO THE CLAIM THAT STRONG INSTITUTIONAL COMMITMENT, ACCOMPANIED BY TRANSPARENCY AND CONSTANT COMMUNICATION WITH REGARDS TO INFLATION TARGETS BY THE CENTRAL BANK, PROVIDES AN ADEQUATE PRICE SIGNALING MECHANISM. IN ADDITION, THE ANALYSIS PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT AN EFFICIENT RULE OF LAW REDUCES CORRUPTION LEVELS SIGNIFICANTLY, ALTHOUGH ITS EFFECTS ARE RATHER MODEST TO SUPPORT THE CLAIMS THAT IT CAN SOLELY LESSEN CORRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR IN THE SAMPLE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

406	FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE AND RELIGION IS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS OF PERSON. THIS FREEDOM IS A CONSTITUTIONALLY REGISTERED FREEDOM AND ITS EXERCISE, LIKE ITS CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES, IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE MODERN CONCEPT OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE'S RULE OF LAW. AT THE SAME TIME, THE CONCEPT OF A DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW IS A SOURCE OF LIMITATIONS FOR THIS FREEDOM, IMPLEMENTED IN THE SPIRIT OF EUROPEAN STANDARDS. THE REGULATION OF THE FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE AND RELIGION UNDER THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND IS A RELATIVELY EXTENSIVE REGULATION, SHOWING ITS OWN SPECIFICITY, ROOTED IN THE EXPERIENCES OF THE PAST, UNDEMOCRATIC POLITICAL REALITY. FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE AND RELIGION CANNOT BE CONSIDERED SOLELY IN THE SPHERE OF THE PSYCHE AND IN THE SPHERE OF PRIVACY. ON THE CONTRARY, IT HAS AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC-LAW DIMENSION. THE ISSUE TAKEN UP IS CLOSELY RELATED TO THE FREEDOM OF WORLDVIEW, WHICH DETERMINES BOTH THE BEHAVIOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL TOWARDS HIMSELF AND THE BEHAVIOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL TOWARDS OTHER PEOPLE AND TOWARDS THE COMMUNITY. THE AUTHOR PRESENTS AND ANALYZES THE REGULATION IN QUESTION AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE PRINCIPLES DETERMINING THE POSITION OF CHURCHES AND RELIGIOUS ASSOCIATIONS IN THE STATE AND THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE STATE.
407	THIS PAPER EXAMINES FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT'S (FDI) EFFECTS ON FOREST AREA CHANGE CONDITIONAL ON GOVERNANCE IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA). THIS RESEARCH IS MOTIVATED BY AN APPARENT LACK OF ATTENTION ON THE UNRESTRAINED EXTRACTION OF NON-RENEWABLE NATURAL RESOURCES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BY MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN THE EMPIRICAL LITERATURE OF POLLUTION HAVEN HYPOTHESIS. USING A PANEL DATA SET OF 38 SSA COUNTRIES, OVER THE PERIOD 1996-2011, THIS STUDY REVEALS THAT FDI HAS A NEGATIVE AND SIGNIFICANT NET EFFECT ON FOREST AREA. THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS EFFECT DEPENDS ON THE LEVEL OF GOVERNANCE IN THESE COUNTRIES, DESPITE THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ON FOREST PRESERVATION. THIS MEANS THAT MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS ACTIVITIES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A LOST OF FOREST COVER DUE TO THE LOW LEVEL OF GOVERNANCE IN SSA. MOREOVER, AMONG THE SELECTED GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT IN A REGIME WHERE THE RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION CONTROL ARE NOT ENFORCED, FDI LEADS TO MORE FOREST DEGRADATION. MORE PRECISELY, A MARGINAL INCREASE IN THE FDI STOCK (RESP. FLOW) CONDITIONAL ON THE AVERAGE LEVELS OF RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION CONTROL LEAD TO A REDUCTION OF 6.63% (RESP. 9.77%) AND 5.74% (RESP. 8.86%) RESPECTIVELY OF FOREST COVER PER CAPITA.
408	IN 2002, KENYA'S NEW NATIONAL RAINBOW COALITION (NARC) UNDERTOOK TO INVESTIGATE AND ENSURE THE RECOVERY OF ALL PUBLIC LANDS ILLEGALLY ALLOCATED BY THE OUTGOING GOVERNMENT. A COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO THE ILLEGAL AND IRREGULAR ALLOCATION OF PUBLIC LAND, CHAIRED BY THE LAWYER PAUL NDUNG'U, WAS APPOINTED. THE COMMISSION'S REPORT SETS OUT THE ILLEGAL LAND AWARDS MADE TO POWERFUL INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES, PROVIDES IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH PUBLIC LAND WAS MISALLOCATED, AND SHOWS HOW THE DOCTRINE THAT PUBLIC LAND SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED AND ALLOCATED 'IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST' WAS CONSISTENTLY PERVERTED. THIS PAPER EXPLORES WHAT THE NDUNG'U REPORT TELLS US ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION IN THE ILLEGAL AND IRREGULAR MISALLOCATION OF PUBLIC LAND. IT MAKES CLEAR THAT THE LEGAL PROFESSION, FAR FROM UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW, HAS PLAYED A CENTRAL ROLE IN LAND CORRUPTION, USING ITS PROFESSIONAL SKILLS AND NETWORKS TO ACCUMULATE PERSONAL WEALTH FOR ITSELF AND OTHERS. THIS STANDS IN CONTRAST TO THE ROLE OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION IN PROMOTING GOOD GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW ENVISAGED BY DONORS OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AID. THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON 'LOCAL' LAND GRABBING, AND ARGUES THAT THE 'GLOBAL LAND GRAB' OR 'INVESTOR RUSH' NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD ALONGSIDE LOCAL MANIFESTATIONS OF LAND PRIVATISATION.
409	SHADOW ECONOMY IS A MAJOR DETERMINANT OF THE ECONOMY SINCE THIS INFORMAL SECTOR HAS AN INTIMATE LINK WITH SOURCES OF GOVERNMENT REVENUE. IN ADDITION, GOOD GOVERNANCE CAN MAKE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO PUBLIC DEBT MANAGEMENT BY CONTROLLING BORROWING COST. THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF THE SHADOW ECONOMY AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON PUBLIC DEBT OF 19 EMERGING AND DEVELOPING ECONOMIES IN ASIA DURING THE PERIOD FROM 2002 TO 2017. THE RESEARCH ANALYZED THE DATA DERIVED FROM THE WORLD BANK AND THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND. POOLED-OLS, FIXED EFFECTS AND GMM REGRESSION METHODS ARE EMPLOYED TO MEASURE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SHADOW ECONOMY, INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND PUBLIC DEBT. THE FINDINGS OF THIS RESEARCH SHOW THAT BOTH SHADOW ECONOMY AND RULE OF LAW HAVE A POSITIVE AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP WITH PUBLIC DEBT. INDEED, INCREASING THE SIZE OF THE SHADOW ECONOMY AND ENHANCING THE RULE OF LAW RESULT IN A HIGHER LEVEL OF PUBLIC DEBT WHILE IMPROVING CONTROL OF CORRUPTION HAS A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH PUBLIC DEBT. THE RESEARCH COULD MAKE SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ECONOMIES IN EMERGING AND DEVELOPING ASIAN COUNTRIES. BASED ON THE FINDINGS, POLICY MAKERS IN THESE COUNTRIES CAN SEEK EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS FOR RAISING INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, AND MINIMIZING THE SIZE OF SHADOW ECONOMY IN ORDER TO MANAGE PUBLIC DEBT.
410	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN WEST AFRICA AFTER THE GREAT RECESSION USING A PANEL OF 13 COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION TO THE TRADITIONAL INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES DOCUMENTED IN THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, SUCH AS GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE/TERRORISM, THE PAPER ALSO DERIVED AN INSTITUTIONAL-QUALITY VARIABLE FROM THE FREEDOM HOUSE DATABASE. TO ADDRESS THE METHODOLOGICAL SHORTCOMINGS IN THE EXTANT LITERATURE, THE STUDY USED REGION-SPECIFIC VARIABLES AND ADOPTED BOTH THE SYSTEM GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS AND THE PANEL TWO-STAGE LEAST SQUARES ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES UNDER THE FRAMEWORK OF A CROSS-COUNTRY GROWTH MODEL. THE RESULTS PREDOMINANTLY SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND GROWTH IN WEST AFRICA. SPECIFICALLY, CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT INEFFECTIVENESS, WEAK REGULATORY QUALITY, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, LACK OF RULE OF LAW AND ABSENCE OF ACCOUNTABILITY WERE FOUND TO HINDER GROWTH IN THE SUB-REGION. HOWEVER, THE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS ALSO SHOWED AN INITIAL LEVEL OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT PER CAPITA, CAPITAL, LABOUR AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AS IMPORTANT DRIVERS OF GROWTH IN THE SUB-REGION. THEREFORE, THE STUDY CONCLUDES THAT THE SUB-REGION NEEDS IMPROVED INSTITUTIONS THAT CAN ATTRACT HIGHER LEVELS OF INVESTMENT TO PROMOTE SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT.
411	FROM 1998 TO 2003, THE SOLOMON ISLANDS FOUND ITSELF IN THE GRIP OF THE TENSIONS', A VIOLENT CIVIL CONFLICT THAT LEFT SOME 200 PEOPLE DEAD, MORE THAN 20,000 DISPLACED, AND COUNTLESS OTHERS SUBJECTED TO TORTURE, RAPE, FEAR AND INTIMIDATION. IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE CONFLICT, TWO DOMINANT APPROACHES TO POST-CONFLICT JUSTICE EMERGED. THE FIRST, IMPLEMENTED BY THE REGIONAL ASSISTANCE MISSION TO THE SOLOMON ISLANDS (RAMSI), FAVOURED A RULE OF LAW' APPROACH ACCORDING TO WHICH LARGE NUMBERS OF MILITANTS ON BOTH SIDES WERE ARRESTED AND PROCESSED THROUGH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM RESULTING, IN MANY CASES, IN THE IMPOSITION OF LENGTHY PERIOD OF IMPRISONMENT. THE SECOND, RECONCILIATION' APPROACH, FAVOURED LOCAL, GRASSROOTS, TRADITIONAL AND INDIGENOUS JUSTICE PROCESSES AND WERE ROUTINELY IMPLEMENTS BY COMMUNITY GROUPS, WOMEN'S ORGANISATIONS AND THE CHURCHES. THIS ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF A FORMALLY PLANNED TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE PROCESS, THESE TWO APPROACHES TO POST-CONFLICT JUSTICE HAVE COME INTO SERIOUS TENSION WITH PROPONENTS OF EACH ACCUSING THE OTHER OF HAMPERING THEIR JUSTICE EFFORTS. IT EXAMINES THOSE TENSIONS AND ANALYSES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE SOLOMON ISLANDS' TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION, DESIGNED IN PART TO PROVIDE A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND RECONCILIATION APPROACHES, HAS BEEN ABLE TO QUELL THIS NEW SET OF TENSIONS.
412	IN THE LATTER HALF OF THE 20TH CENTURY, WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHILOSOPHY STUDIES, WESTERN JURISPRUDENCE ALSO WITNESSED A LINGUISTIC TURN IN ITS FIELD. A SERIES OF ACADEMIC SCHOOLS APPEARED CONSECUTIVELY, SUCH AS THE SCHOOL OF SEMANTIC ANALYSIS, THE SCHOOL OF NEW RHETORIC, THE SCHOOL OF LEGAL INTERPRETATION, AND THE SCHOOL OF STRUCTURAL SEMIOTICS. THEIR ANALYTICAL PARADIGMS, WHICH WERE SKEPTICAL OF THE VIEWS OF LEGAL LANGUAGES IN TRADITIONAL THEORIES OF JURISPRUDENCE, ARE INTERDISCIPLINARY AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL IN NATURE AND CHARACTERISTICS. NORMALLY, THERE ARE THREE METHODS USED IN THE LINGUISTIC TURN OF WESTERN JURISPRUDENCE, THAT IS, THE METHOD OF SYMBOLIC RESTORATION, THE METHOD OF STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS, AND THE METHOD OF LEGAL HERMENEUTICS. PROMOTED BY THE LINGUISTIC TURN, TWO TRADITIONS OF LEGAL SEMIOTICS ALSO DEVELOPED. ONE IS THE LEGAL THEORY BASED ON GREIMASIAN SEMIOTICS, AND THE OTHER IS BASED ON PEIRCEAN SEMIOTICS. THE LINGUISTIC TURN IN JURISPRUDENCE STILL REPRESENTS A BREAKTHROUGH AND INNOVATION IN THE PARADIGM OF LEGAL THEORETICAL STUDIES, AS IT LEADS TO A RE-EXAMINATION OF LANGUAGE, WHICH IS NO LONGER TREATED AS A TOOL BUT AS A PHILOSOPHICAL AFTERTHOUGHT IN RELATION TO THE HUMAN BEING.
413	THIS YEAR, TEN YEARS WILL HAVE PASSED SINCE GERMAN UNIFICATION ON OCTOBER 3, 1990. AFTER THE WALL CAME DOWN, EAST AND WEST FACED THE CHALLENGES OF ASSIMILATING CULTURES AND "MASTERING THE PAST" OF THE SOCIALIST REGIME. THIS COMING TO TERMS WITH THE PAST INCLUDED THE TRIALS AND CONVICTIONS OF EAST GERMAN BORDER GUARDS AND THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NEARLY 600 DEATHS AT THE INTER-GERMAN BORDER THE CONVICTIONS RAISE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS. WHAT WAS THE LAW IN EAST GERMANY-THE LANGUAGE ON THE STATUTE BOOKS OR THE SECRET ORDERS TO KILL RATHER THAN TO PERMIT ESCAPE? MAY THE COURTS RESORT TO NOTIONS OF MORALITY TO DEAL WITH A SYSTEM OF STATE INJUSTICE, HOLDING THAT WICKED RULES CANNOT BE LAW? AND, ULTIMATELY, SHOULD THE BAN ON RETROACTIVE PUNISHMENT APPLY IN TIMES OF TRANSITION FROM AN UNJUST SYSTEM TO A RULE-OF-LAW DEMOCRACY? WHILE THERE ARE NO EASY ANSWERS, THE JUDGMENTS ARE A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE EFFORT OF JOINING TWO SOCIETIES AND BUILDING A STABLE DEMOCRACY FOR THE FUTURE. THE CASES WERE DECIDED CORRECTLY BECAUSE THEY CONDEMN THE KILLINGS AND VINDICATE THE EAST GERMANS' SENSE OF JUSTICE AND LAW, YET EMPHASIZE THE RULE OF LAW. IN THIS WAY, THE DECISIONS AID THE PROCESS OF COMING TO TERMS WITH THE PAST.
414	IN THE LATE 1860S AND EARLY 1870S THE BRITISH COLONIAL GOVERNMENT IN INDIA SUPPRESSED AN IMAGINED WAHHABI CONSPIRACY, WHICH IT PORTRAYED AS A PROFOUND THREAT TO IMPERIAL SECURITY. THE DETENTION AND TRIAL OF AMIR AND HASHMADAD KHAN-POPULARLY KNOWN AS THE GREAT WAHHABI CASE-WAS THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL OF A SERIES OF PUBLIC TRIALS OF SUSPECTED WAHHABIS. THE GOVERNMENT JUSTIFIED EXTRAJUDICIAL ARRESTS AND DETENTIONS AS BEING CRUCIAL TO PROTECT THE EMPIRE FROM ANTI-COLONIAL REBELS INSPIRED BY FANATICAL RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. THE GOVERNMENT'S CASE AGAINST THE KHAN BROTHERS, HOWEVER, WAS EXCEPTIONALLY WEAK. THEIR ONGOING DETENTION SPARKED A SUSTAINED PUBLIC DEBATE ABOUT THE BALANCE BETWEEN EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN NEWSPAPERS AND PAMPHLETS PUBLISHED IN INDIA AND BRITAIN, INDIAN JOURNALISTS AND ANGLO-INDIAN LAWYERS ARGUED THAT ARBITRARY POLICE POWERS POSED A GREATER THREAT TO PUBLIC SECURITY THAN RELIGIOUS FANATICS. IN DOING SO, THEY EMBRACED A LANGUAGE OF LIBERALISM WHICH EMPHASIZED THE RULE OF LAW AND ASSERTED THE ROLE OF PUBLIC OPINION AS A CHECK ON GOVERNMENT DESPOTISM. DEBATES ABOUT THE GREAT WAHHABI CASE DEMONSTRATE THE ONGOING CONTEST BETWEEN AUTHORITARIAN AND LIBERAL STRANDS OF IMPERIAL IDEOLOGY, EVEN AT THE HEIGHT OF THE PANIC OVER THE INTERTWINED THREAT OF INDIAN SEDITION AND FANATICAL ISLAM.
415	'GOOD GOVERNANCE' IS INCREASINGLY REGARDED AS PIVOTAL TO DEVELOPMENT IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE SIX INDICATORS RECOGNIZED AS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEASUREMENT TOOLS OF 'GOOD GOVERNANCE' ACROSS THE WORLD ARE: VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY; POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE; GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS; REGULATORY QUALITY; RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION (KAUFMANN, KRAAY AND LOBATON, 2003: 8-9). THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES HOW LACK OF 'GOOD GOVERNANCE' AFFECTS THE SUCCESS AND SUSTAINABILITY OF THE MARKET-BASED REFORMS UNDERTAKEN IN THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR OF BANGLADESH. THE REFORMS HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED FOOD GRAIN PRODUCTION, IMPROVED FOOD SECURITY CONDITIONS AND EASY ACCESS BY FARMERS TO AGRICULTURAL INPUTS. HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM HAS ARISEN RECENTLY: THE SALE OF LOW QUALITY AND UNDERWEIGHT AGRICULTURAL INPUTS SOMETIMES AT HIGHER PRICES HAS BECOME COMMON. NOT ONLY IS THIS PROBLEM UNDERMINING THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF THE REFORMS, IT IS ALSO THREATENING THEIR SUSTAINABILITY. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT THE PROBLEMS WITH REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION - INDICATORS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE - ARE THE UNDERLYING REASONS FOR THIS PROBLEM. IN THE CONTEXT OF INCREASING PRESSURES FROM DONORS TO PURSUE MARKET-BASED REFORMS, THIS PAPER STRESSES THE NEED FOR INTEGRATED GOVERNANCE LINKING GOVERNMENT, BUSINESS AND CIVIL SOCIETY AS PARAMOUNT FOR PROMOTING GOOD GOVERNANCE FOR THE SUCCESS AND SUSTAINABILITY OF THE REFORMS.
416	THE PRINCIPLE OF FAIRNESS ADVOCATES AGAINST INTERNATIONAL DOUBLE TAXATION AND INTERNATIONAL DOUBLE NON-TAXATION. COUNTRIES AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS (OECD, G20 AND EU) HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL INITIATIVES AGAINST SUCH TAXATION. HOWEVER, THESE INITIATIVES ARE NOT ALWAYS EFFECTIVE. ALSO, CERTAIN LEGAL AUTHORS QUESTION THE LEGITIMACY OF THE OECD AND ITS ACTION PLAN ON BEPS. THE ESSENTIAL GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO FIND GUIDELINES TO ADDRESS INTERNATIONAL DOUBLE (NON-) TAXATION. WE FIRST ARGUE THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF FAIRNESS IS REFLECTED IN THE LEGAL PRINCIPLES OF PROPORTIONALITY, NON-DISCRIMINATION AND THE RULE OF LAW. SUBSEQUENTLY, WE DERIVE GUIDELINES FROM THESE PRINCIPLES. WE ADDRESS THE RESEARCH QUESTION BY REFERENCE TO THESE PRINCIPLES AS ENSHRINED IN THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS (ECHR) AND IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDERS OF BELGIUM, FRANCE, GERMANY AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. OUR MAIN CONCLUSION IS THAT EXCESSIVE INTERNATIONAL DOUBLE TAXATION AND UNINTENDED INTERNATIONAL DOUBLE NON-TAXATION DO NOT SIT WELL WITH A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH AS ADVOCATED BY THE LEGAL PRINCIPLES. WE ALSO ARGUE THAT THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES THE NATIONAL STATES TO GUARANTEE THE BALANCING OF ALL RELEVANT NATIONAL INTERESTS THROUGH IN-DEPTH PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE. FINALLY, WE SUBMIT THAT CROSS-POLLINATION BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE LEGITIMACY OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS.
417	EVER SINCE MORROW'S SEMINAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE STUDY OF PLATO'S LAWS, THE NOCTURNAL COUNCIL DESCRIBED IN BOOK XII OF THE LAWS HAS BEEN GENERALLY AGREED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE REST OF THE WORK. IN A RECENT PIECE IN POLITICAL STUDIES, HOWEVER, GEORGE KLOSKO REVIVES THE OLDER ARGUMENT AGAINST MORROW'S INTERPRETATION, ARGUING THAT THE NOCTURNAL COUNCIL REALLY IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE OVERALL PROJECT OF THE LAWS, AND THAT THE BEST EXPLANATION FOR THIS INCONSISTENCY IS THAT PLATO CHANGED HIS MIND IN THE COURSE OF WRITING THE LAWS BUT WAS UNABLE FULLY TO 'WORK OUT' THE 'PHILOSOPHICAL IMPLICATIONS' OF THIS CHANGE BEFORE HE DIED. I ARGUE IN THIS ARTICLE THAT KLOSKO'S ARGUMENTS DO NOT SUCCEED, AND THAT MORROW'S INTERPRETATION OF THE NOCTURNAL COUNCIL IS STILL THE BEST ACCOUNT OF ITS ROLE THAT WE POSSESS. BUT BEYOND THE NARROW POINT CONCERNING THE INTERPRETATION OF THE ROLE OF THE NOCTURNAL COUNCIL IN THE LAWS, I ARGUE THAT KLOSKO MISINTERPRETS PLATO'S ARGUMENTS FOR THE RULE OF LAW. A PROPER INTERPRETATION OF THESE ARGUMENTS SHOWS THAT PLATO'S DEFENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW NEVER RULES OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF IMPROVING THE LAW THROUGH THE ACCUMULATION OF NEW EXPERIENCE, AND HENCE IS NOWHERE INCOMPATIBLE WITH A COMMITMENT TO INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE NOCTURNAL COUNCIL.
418	GARY BORN'S ARTICLE 'THE 1933 DIRECTIVES ON ARBITRATION OF THE GERMAN REICH: ECHOES OF THE PAST?' FASCINATES FOR GOOD AND NOT SO GOOD REASONS IN ALMOST EQUAL MEASURE. THE AUTHOR SKILLFULLY ILLUMINATED A RARELY-DISCUSSED EPISODE OF ARBITRAL LEGAL HISTORY AND AIMED TO APPLY ITS LESSONS TO CURRENT DEBATES SURROUNDING INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT (ISDS) REFORM. THE OVERARCHING ARGUMENT IS THAT CRITICISM AND/OR REFORM OF INVESTOR-STATE ARBITRATION IS RECKLESS AND REMINISCENT OF NATIONAL SOCIALIST EFFORTS TO CURB PRIVATE-PUBLIC ARBITRATION - RISKING UNDERMINING THE RULE OF LAW AND EVEN ALLOWING 'HISTORY TO REPEAT ITSELF'. AS MUCH AS THE LEGAL HISTORY PART IS A WORTHY CONTRIBUTION, THIS LATER PART IS LADEN WITH PROBLEMATIC CLAIMS AND UNFORTUNATE PARALLELS. THE CRITICISMS AND POTENTIAL (FAIRLY LIMITED) REFORMS OF ISDS ARE PORTRAYED AS MISSTEPS TOWARDS A TOTALITARIAN ABYSS. YET AS MUCH AS INVESTOR-STATE ARBITRATION CAN SOMETIMES HELP PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW, IT IS NOT AN INDISPENSABLE 'BULWARK' AGAINST STATE OPPRESSION. ISDS IS A HISTORICALLY RECENT INVENTION, WITH AN EVEN MORE RECENT CASE LAW. IT DEALS WITH WIDE-REACHING AND OBJECTIVELY OFTEN CONTROVERSIAL SUBSTANTIVE RULES, MAKING REFORM PROPOSALS UNSURPRISING. CRUCIALLY, EVEN IF INVESTOR -STATE ARBITRATION DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY, THE HISTORY OF NAZI HORRORS WOULD NOT REPEAT ITSELF.
419	DOES THE VARIATION IN THE QUALITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS AFFECT THE CAPACITY OF FIRMS TO INNOVATE? THIS PAPER USES A UNIQUE DATASET THAT COMBINES THE SPECIFIC FEATURES OF 2,700 FIRMS WITH THE INSTITUTIONAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE 25 CITIES IN CHINA WHERE THEY OPERATE, IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE EXTENT TO WHICH INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY - MEASURED ACROSS FOUR DIMENSIONS: RULE OF LAW, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, CORRUPTION, AND REGULATORY QUALITY - AFFECTS BOTH THE INNOVATION PROBABILITY AND INTENSITY OF FIRMS. THE RESULTS OF THE ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS SHOW THAT POOR INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN URBAN CHINA IS AN IMPORTANT BARRIER FOR FIRM-LEVEL INNOVATION. IN PARTICULAR, A DEFICIENT RULE OF LAW, HIGH CORRUPTION, AND A WEAK REGULATORY QUALITY STRONGLY UNDERMINE FIRM-LEVEL INNOVATION. THE ROLE OF THESE FACTORS IS FAR MORE LIMITED IN THE CASE OF INNOVATION INTENSITY. BETTER INSTITUTIONS ALSO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME FIRMS SPEND DEALING WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN ORDER TO FACILITATE INNOVATION. THE RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THAT THE COST OF WEAK INSTITUTIONS FOR INNOVATION IS HIGHER FOR PRIVATE THAN FOR STATE-OWNED FIRMS, AT LEAST IN THE EARLY STAGES OF INNOVATION. IN GENERAL, DIFFERENCES IN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY GENERATE LOCAL URBAN ECOSYSTEMS THAT IMPINGE ON THE PROPENSITY OF FIRMS TO INNOVATE.
420	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF THE MACROENVIRONMENT ON ENTERPRISES IN EURO-AREA COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 2006-2020. OUR STUDY BUILDS ON IMPORTANT WORKS AND THEORIES IN THE FIELD OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE WORK OF KAR AND OZSAHIN. WE EMPLOY THE PANEL LEAST SQUARES METHOD TO ESTIMATE THE COEFFICIENT OF SELECTED VARIABLES. WE IDENTIFY POLITICAL, INSTITUTIONAL (GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS INDEX, REGULATORY QUALITY INDEX, RULE OF LAW, MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF COMPANY, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE) AND FINANCIAL (FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT INDEX, GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT, INFLATION RATE, UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, PUBLIC DEBT) DETERMINANTS THAT CAN HAVE AN EFFECT ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THE ARTICLE AIMS TO FILL A GAP IN THE EXISTING LITERATURE BY PROVIDING NEW INSIGHTS FROM THE EUROZONE AND UPDATED DATA THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN PREVIOUS LITERATURE REVIEWS AND STUDIES. IN THIS WAY, WE CONTRIBUTE TO EXPANDING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MACROECONOMIC FACTORS AND ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITIES IN THIS SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHICAL AREA, CONSIDERING THE LACK OF CURRENT ANALYSES. ACCORDING TO OUR RESULTS, THERE IS A POSITIVE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT PER CAPITA, REGULATORY QUALITY INDEX, AND MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF THE COMPANY AND A NEGATIVE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND RULE OF LAW, AND PUBLIC DEBT.
421	THE JUDICIAL REVIEW OF GOVERNMENT ACTIONS IS OFTEN USED AS A BELLWETHER OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA. ACCORDINGLY, IN GAUGING THE DIRECTION OF LEGAL REFORM IN THE XI ERA, MEDIA REPORTS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED CHANGES IN LITIGATION AGAINST GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AS EVIDENCE OF POSITIVE MOVEMENT TOWARDS GREATER RULE OF LAW. WE PROVIDE A SELECTIVE REVIEW OF CHANGES IN CHINA'S ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATION SYSTEM IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, GIVING SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE AMENDMENT IN 2014 OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATION LAW (ALL), AND A 2018 SUPREME PEOPLE'S COURT INTERPRETATION OF THE SAME STATUTE. IN OUR VIEW, THE QUESTION OF WHETHER LAWSUITS MIGHT BE BROUGHT AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT HAS ARGUABLY BEEN SUPERSEDED IN IMPORTANCE BY THE QUESTION OF HOW COURTS WILL DECIDE SUCH LAWSUITS. AND THE GENERIC NOTION OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE ITSELF NO LONGER SHEDS SUFFICIENT LIGHT ON ACTUAL AND POSSIBLE JUDICIAL RESPONSES. USING THE PURPORTEDLY EXPANDED SCOPE OF REVIEW OF INFORMAL POLICY DIRECTIVES AS AN EXAMPLE, WE SHOW THAT SYMBOLISM-MOTIVATED ADVOCACY TO IMPROVE THE ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATION IN CHINA MAY COME AT THE EXPENSE OF PROTECTING THE NON-SYMBOLIC FUNCTIONS OF JUDICIAL REVIEW, E.G.. THE COHERENCE OF LAW AND CONSISTENCY IN THE DELIVERY OF JUSTICE.
422	SEPARATION AND BALANCE OF POWERS IS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES WHICH IS A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN ANY CONTEMPORARY. THE RECOGNITION OF THIS PRINCIPLE DOES NOT IMPLY THAT EVEN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AUTHORITIES MUST HAVE A RIGID BEHAVIOUR, AND THAT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE AND EXERCISE A DISCRETIONARY POWER, A RIGHT OF APPRECIATION. HOWEVER, THE EXERCISE OF SUCH POWER OR RIGHT MUST BE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THAT PRINCIPLE AND, IMPLICITLY, OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY. NOWDAYS, WE CAN OBSERVE THAT ANY PUBLIC AUTHORITY, AS WELL AS THOSE IN THE SPHERE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, TRIES TO FORCE THE LIMITS OF ITS DISCRETIONARY POWER, OR SUCH A BEHAVIOUR COULD AFFECT THE CORRECT AND CONSTITUTIONAL FUNCTIONING OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE IS INTENDED TO BE ONLY AN INITIAL APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS RELEVANT TO THE PROPOSED THEME BY USING METHODS SUCH AS COMPARATIVE OR SYSTEMIC METHOD. THUS, WE WANT TO IDENTIFY THOSE CONSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS THAT CONSTITUTIONAL LEGISLATORS HAVE ESTABLISHED TO PREVENT OVERCOMING THE LIMITS OF THIS DISCRETIONARY POWER. LATER, THROUGH OTHER ARTICLES, WE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO IDENTIFY THE RISK FACTORS THAT ARISE IN SUCH SITUATIONS, AS WELL AS POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO REDUCE OR EVEN ELIMINATE THESE FACTORS.
423	IT HAS BEEN FORTY YEARS SINCE THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY (CCP) INITIATED THE MODERNIZATION PROJECT OF POST-MAO CHINA. AS WITH OTHER SECTORS, LEARNING FROM THE WEST WAS ONE OF THE BASIC STRATEGIES TAKEN BY THE CCP TO ACHIEVE THE MODERNIZATION OF CHINESE SOCIALIST LEGALITY, EVEN AS CHINESE LAW IS MEANT TO BE GROUNDED IN THE ORTHODOXIES OF MARXISM-LENINISM. IN ORDER TO LEARN FROM THE WEST, THE CCP GENERALLY ADOPTED AN ELASTIC AND DUALISTIC APPROACH TO REFORM THAT IS BASED ON THE UTILITARIAN INCENTIVES OF DENG XIAOPING. IN THE POLITICAL SECTOR, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CCP LOOKED BACK INTO THE PAST AND THE CCP'S SUCCESSFUL EXPERIENCES UNDER MARXIST-LENINIST DOCTRINE. THE AIM WAS TO IMMUNIZE POLITICS FROM THE INFLUENCE OF WESTERN LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC IDEOLOGY. BUT IN THE ECONOMIC AREA, THE CCP MOVED TOWARD THE WEST BY VIGOROUSLY ADOPTING ADVANCED WESTERN RULES AND INSTITUTIONS FOR MANAGING THE ECONOMY. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW THIS STRATEGY FORMED THE BASIC CONTOURS OF CHINESE SOCIALIST LEGALITY IN THE PAST FORTY YEARS. THE ARTICLE IDENTIFIES THE RESULTING INTERNAL LACUNA, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE REALIZATION OF THE "RULE OF LAW." THIS ARTICLE ALSO ANALYSES THE POSSIBLE FUTURE OF A CHINESE-SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW. THAT POSSIBILITY WILL BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES, PARTICULARLY THE DETERIORATION OF CHINA-US RELATIONS.
424	THIS STUDY EXPLORES HOW CERTAIN INSTITUTIONAL DIMENSIONS INFLUENCE ENTREPRENEURIAL ALLOCATIONS IN NIGERIA AND ITS SECTORIAL HETEROGENEITY. WE APPLY UNCONDITIONAL FIXED-EFFECT TOBIT REGRESSION ESTIMATORS ON A COMBINED DATASET EXTRACTED FROM VARIOUS SOURCES OVER THE PERIOD 2011-2015. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PROPERTY RIGHTS AND OIL RENTS STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS TO BE INNOVATIVE, WHILE A NUMBER OF BUSINESS PROCEDURES AND THE RULE OF LAW DISCOURAGE THEM FROM BEING INNOVATIVE. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT SOME OF THE INSTITUTIONS ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO ONE ANOTHER IN IMPROVING ENTREPRENEURIAL INNOVATIVENESS. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THEM ARE POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT. SECTORIAL RESULTS REVEAL THAT PROPERTY RIGHTS, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND OIL RENTS SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE ENTREPRENEURIAL INNOVATIVENESS, WHEREAS GOVERNMENT SIZE REDUCES INNOVATIVENESS AMONG YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR. IN THE IT SECTOR, PROPERTY RIGHTS, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, REGULATORY QUALITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS INCREASE ENTREPRENEURIAL INNOVATIVENESS. GOVERNMENT SIZE, BUSINESS PROCEDURES AND THE RULE OF LAW REDUCE INNOVATIVENESS. OVERALL, THE INSTITUTIONS APPEAR TO HAVE STRONGER AND BIGGER EFFECTS IN THE IT SECTOR THAN THEY DO IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR. POLICY IMPLICATIONS INCLUDE THE NEED FOR INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS TARGETING PRODUCTIVE ENTREPRENEURSHIP TO FOCUS MORE ON MAKING BUSINESS REGULATION AND PROCEDURES MORE COMPETITION-FRIENDLY AND LESS CUMBERSOME AND STRENGTHENING THE QUALITY OF ANTI-GRAFT AND PROPERTY RIGHT INSTITUTIONS.
425	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (POLITICAL STABILITY, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, RULE OF LAW, REGULARITY QUALITY, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS) ON FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) FLOWS TO AFRICAN COUNTRIES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE AUTHORS EMPLOYED A PANEL REGRESSION MODEL ON DATA FROM 50 AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 1996 TO 2010. THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS USES THE FIXED AND RANDOM EFFECTS ESTIMATION. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS OBTAINED THROUGH FIXED AND RANDOM EFFECTS INDICATE THAT OUT OF THE SIX WORLD BANK'S GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, THREE ARE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. THESE ARE VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND RULE OF LAW. THIS RESULT IMPLIES THAT TO IMPROVE THEIR INVESTMENT CLIMATE AND INCREASE THE INFLOW OF FDI, AFRICAN COUNTRIES NEED TO IMPROVE THE STATE OF GOVERNANCE. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE MAJOR LIMITATION OF THIS PAPER IS THE ABSENCE OF DIFFERENT SOURCES FOR GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, AND ABSENCE OF LONG TIME SERIES DATA ON SOME OTHER GOVERNANCE INDICATORS SUCH AS TRANSPARENCY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THESE RESULTS LEAD TO THE CONCLUSION THAT SOME GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR FOREIGN INVESTORS IN THEIR INVESTMENT DECISIONS, WHILE OTHER INDICATORS ARE NOT. GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO CONSIDER THESE INDICATORS WHILE TRYING TO ATTRACT FOREIGN INVESTMENT.
426	THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE QUESTION WHETHER THE DICTATORIAL POPULIST GOVERNMENTS, TODAY APPEALING TO MULTIPLE SECTORS OF CITIZENS, HAVE REALLY THE POWER TO SOLVE SOCIAL PROBLEMS THAT THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW GOVERNMENTS SEEM UNABLE TO MANAGE AND SOLVE. IT DESCRIBES THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF POPULISMS OF DICTATORIAL NATURE AND, PARTICULARLY, EMPHASIZES THEIR DECISION OF MAKING EXCEPTION OF LAWS AND OF CITIZEN'S RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES AS WELL, IN ORDER TO REBUILD THE RULE OF LAW AND THE SOCIAL POLICIES EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DEMOCRATIC REGIME AND REINSTATE THE SOCIAL ORDER. SINCE THE POPULIST AUTHORITARIAN POSITION CLAIMS TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, PRODUCING THE SOCIAL RESULTS DEMANDED BY PEOPLE, THE QUESTION OF ITS EFFECTIVENESS IS CRUCIAL. IN SOCIETIES CRUSHED BY ANY SORT OF NEEDS AND PRIVATIONS, THE POPULISM IS LIKELY TO BE AN APPRAISED AND DESIRABLE GOVERNMENT, BUT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF ITS UNLAWFUL DECISIONS, SUBJECTION OF PUBLIC POWERS, HARASSMENT OF DISSENTERS AND FORESEEABLE INSUFFICIENCY OF RESOURCES TO PERFORM A SOLUTION OF THE NEEDS, POVERTY AND INEQUALITIES MAKE THE CITIZENS TO REASSESS THE TRADEOFF THEY MADE BETWEEN THEIR LIBERTY AND SUBMISSIVENESS TO THE POPULIST LEADER AS LONG AS GETTING A RELIEF OF ITS NEEDS. THE COLLAPSE OF THE POPULIST AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNANCE IS ITS FORESEEABLE INEFFECTIVENESS, LINKED TO THE RESURGENCE OF LIBERTIES.
427	THERE WAS A WIDESPREAD EUPHORIA IN THE 1990S THAT INTRODUCING WESTERN-STYLE LEGAL INSTITUTIONS AND TRADITIONS WOULD PLAY A PIVOTAL ROLE IN PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRATIZATION IN POST-SOVIET SOCIETIES. LIKE OTHER POST-SOVIET STATES, UZBEKISTAN HAS BECOME A 'LABORATORY' FOR TESTING VARIOUS GLOBAL (WESTERN) GOOD GOVERNANCE AND RULE OF LAW INITIATIVES. AS A RESULT OF THESE INTERVENTIONS, UZBEKISTAN'S LEGAL SYSTEM REPRESENTS A PECULIAR BLEND OF WESTERN AND SOVIET LEGAL CULTURES: WESTERN" FROM THE "LAW IN BOOKS" PERSPECTIVE (WHEN WE ANALYZE ITS WRITTEN LAWS AND REGULATIONS) AND "SOVIET" FROM THE "LAW IN ACTION" PERSPECTIVE (WHEN OBSERVING HOW LAWS ARE APPLIED AND ENACTED BY STATE INSTITUTIONS AND OFFICIALS). HOWEVER, ONE DORMANT BUT HIGHLY SALIENT LEGAL ORDER OVERLOOKED IN THE LITERATURE ON UZBEKISTAN IS THE LEGACY OF ISLAMIC LEGAL CULTURE. WITH THIS IN MIND, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE LEGACY AND CONTEXT OF ISLAMIC LEGAL CULTURE IN UZBEKISTAN. I ARGUE THAT THE MORE THE FOCUS MOVES FROM STATE-CENTERED UNDERSTANDINGS OF LAW TO ETHNOGRAPHIC ANALYSES OF EVERYDAY LIFE AND MICRO-LEVEL SOCIAL PROCESSES AND STRUCTURES, THE MORE IT BECOMES DISCERNIBLE THAT ISLAM SERVES AS A LEGAL ORDER IN UZBEKISTAN. THESE PROCESSES WILL BE EXPLORED THROUGH THE ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDY OF MAHALLAS (NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITIES) IN FERGHANA, UZBEKISTAN.
428	THIS ARTICLE CENTERS ON THE IDEA THAT THERE IS A NON-FUNGIBLE VALUE INHERENT IN LOCAL ASSOCIATIONS. IT USES THE WORK OF PAUL KAHN TO ANIMATE WHAT THAT VALUE MIGHT BE AND TO CONSIDER WHY LAW MIGHT NOT HAVE A CLEAR SIGHTLINE TO IT. IN DEMOCRACY IN OUR AMERICA, KAHN, LEANING ON TOCQUEVILLE'S EARLIER WORK, REFLECTS ON THE NATURE OF VOLUNTEERISM IN LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT AND THE VALUE OF LOCAL ASSOCIATIONS. DRAWING ON HIS EXPERIENCE-BASED ACCOUNT OF THE PRACTICE OF LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT, I SUGGEST THAT LOCAL ASSOCIATIONS HAVE A NON-FUNGIBLE VALUE WHICH COMES IN THREE DIMENSIONS: THE DIMENSION OF CARE, THE DIMENSION OF CHARACTER, AND THE DIMENSION OF FORUM VIBRANCY. IN THE CULTURAL STUDY OF LAW, MEANWHILE, KAHN CONSIDERS WHAT THE PRACTICE OF THE RULE OF LAW LOOKS LIKE AND SUGGESTS THAT LAW IS BLIND TO OTHER POSSIBLE WAYS OF FRAMING AND ANALYZING EVENTS. BUILDING ON THIS PERSPECTIVE, I REFLECT ON HOW THE PRACTICE OF THE RULE OF LAW ENDS UP BEING BLIND TO THE VALUE THAT IS INTRINSIC TO THE LOCAL ASSOCIATIONS THAT VIVIFY LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THROUGH THIS LENS, WE CAN ALSO UNDERSTAND MORE FULLY THAN HAS BEEN POSSIBLE TO DATE WHY LEGAL CODIFICATIONS OF THE PRINCIPLE OF SUBSIDIARITY FAIL TO RESULT IN A GENUINE PREFERENCE FOR PROXIMITY.
429	THE SINGULARITY OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AD, WHICH TRANSCENDS HUMAN INTELLIGENCE TO PLAY THE ROLE OF GOD, IS IMMINENT IN THIS CONTEXT, THE CHINESE JUDICIAL SYSTEM HAS GAINED SOME LATECOMER ADVANTAGE, WITH THE HELP OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, THE INTERNET, BIG DATA, CLOUD COMPUTING, AND AI TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND TRANSPARENCY OF CASE HANDLING. THE TRIAL PROCESS HAS UNDERGONE EXTENSIVE AND PROFOUND QUALITATIVE MUTATIONS. THIS REPRESENTS A CHALLENGE TO THE INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS OF THE MODERN RULE OF LAW. AT THIS STAGE, WE SHOULD ADOPT A CAUTIOUS AND PRUDENT ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE DESIGN AND APPLICATION OF LEGAL-EXPERT SYSTEMS AS WELL AS MACHINE LEARNING. ESPECIALLY FROM THE ASPECT OF COMPUTER SENTENCING, IT IS EVEN MORE NECESSARY TO AVOID A RUSH FOR QUICK RESULTS, AND THERE IS NO NEED TO COMPLETELY EXCLUDE THE JUDGE'S DISCRETION AND FREE EVALUATION OF THE EVIDENCE THROUGH INNER CONVICTION. THE FINALITY OF THE JUDICIAL POWER IS DESTINED TO CHOOSE A CORRECT FINAL SOLUTION THROUGH A DEBATE ON THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST MECHANISM. IN THE FACE OF SUCH A MODERN RULE-OF-LAW SYSTEM, BIG DATA, CLOUD COMPUTING, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, AND AI ARE JUST AUXILIARY MEANS TO ACHIEVE LEGAL JUSTICE. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSES. THIS IS A BASIC PRINCIPLE THAT WE SHOULD ALWAYS BEAR IN MIND.
430	INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT OF A COUNTRY PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR INNOVATION ACTIVITIES. OUR RESULTS CONFIRM THAT EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT OF EMERGING COUNTRIES INFLUENCE THE R&D INVESTMENT. USING GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM) ESTIMATION OF PANEL DATA FOR 664 FIRMS FROM SELECTED 20 EMERGING MARKETS DURING THE PERIOD OF 2006-2013, WE FIND THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON R&D INVESTMENT. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW, AND REGULARITY QUALITY HAVE POSITIVE IMPACT, WHILE CORRUPTION AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON R&D INVESTMENT IN THE EMERGING MARKETS. WE ALSO PERFORMED ELASTICITY TEST TO COMPARE AMONG THE INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT AMONG THE INSTITUTIONAL DETERMINANTS, CORRUPTION OF A PARTICULAR EMERGING COUNTRY IS FOUND TO BE MOST IMPORTANT IN INFLUENCING R&D INVESTMENT FOLLOWED BY REGULARITY QUALITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW, AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY. THESE RESULTS WOULD BE HELPFUL TO INVESTORS AND POLICY MAKERS TO ASSESS THE REQUIREMENTS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE THAT TO ATTRACT MORE R&D INVESTMENT AS A SOURCE OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, GOVERNMENT SHOULD ENSURE A SOUND AND STABLE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT ALONG WITH STRENGTHENING OTHER FIRM LEVEL FACTORS AS INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS ARE MORE IMPORTANT TO EXPLAIN THE VARIATION OVER THE TIME AND ALSO COST EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION.
431	A KEY FEATURE OF THE POLITICAL LIBERALIZATION MOVEMENTS THAT ENGULFED AFRICA IN THE 1990S WAS THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS MANY OF THEM GENERATED. IN ADDITION TO PURSUING REGIME CHANGE, THERE WAS ALSO THE DESIRE TO CHANGE THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE. ACROSS FRENCH-SPEAKING AFRICA, MANY COUNTRIES SUBSTANTIALLY AMENDED THEIR CONSTITUTIONS OR WROTE NEW ONES AS PART OF THE MOVEMENT TO CREATE POLITICAL GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS BASED ON HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RULE OF LAW AND CONSTITUTIONALISM. IN MOST CASES, THE REFORMS ESTABLISHED SPECIALIZED INSTITUTIONS OF JUDICIAL REVIEW, MODELED LARGELY ON THE FRENCH CONSEIL CONSTITUTIONNEL CREATED IN 1958. CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF AND OWING TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT, SOME OF THESE INSTITUTIONS TOOK A MORE INTEGRATIVE AND INNOVATIVE APPROACH THAN THAT OF THE FRENCH CONSTITUTION, BY BORROWING MORE EVOLVED FEATURES OF JUDICIAL REVIEW SYSTEMS ELSEWHERE, AND BY DEVELOPING UNTESTED SUI GENERIS FEATURES. IN WHAT WAYS DID THIS HAPPEN? WHAT ARE THESE FEATURES AND WHAT FACTORS ACCOUNT FOR THEM? HOW IS THIS RELEVANT TO THE PROMOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RULE OF LAW AND CONSTITUTIONALISM IN FRANCOPHONE AFRICA? FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON SUB-SAHARAN FRANCOP HONE AFRICA, THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THESE QUESTIONS. IT WILL SHOW THAT FROM THE OUTSET, CONSTITUTION MAKERS IN THIS REGION WERE ALREADY TAILORING THE DESIGN OF JUDICIAL REVIEW INSTITUTIONS TO LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES, DESPITE EXTERNAL INFLUENCES.
432	DESPITE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH, THE FISHERIES SUPPLY CHAIN IS COMPLICATED DUE TO VARIOUS TYPES OF STAKEHOLDERS PER-FORMING MULTIPLE TASKS, WHICH MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS AFFECTING FINANCIAL AND RELATIONAL GOVERNANCE IN BANGLA-DESH'S INLAND FISHING INDUSTRY. A TOTAL OF 779 STAKEHOLDERS FROM 11 DISTRICTS WERE CHOSEN RANDOMLY AND INTER-VIEWED DIRECTLY USING A STRUCTURED INTERVIEW SCHEDULE COVERING 46 FISH MARKETS. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES, WE USED A PLS-SEM MODEL IN CONJUNCTION WITH A PERCEPTION INDEX. THE PERCEPTION INDEX REVEALED THAT THE STATUS OF LOCAL POWER AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE FISHERIES SUPPLY CHAIN WAS LOW. THE OVERALL STATE OF FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE WAS AT AN INTERMEDIATE LEVEL, WITH RELATIONAL GOVERNANCE IN GOOD SHAPE. PLS-SEM FOUND A NEGATIVE AND SIGNIFICANT EFFECT FOR COLLECTIVE POWER AND LOCAL POWER ON FINANCIAL AND RELATIONAL GOVERNANCE, WHEREAS INSTITUTIONAL POWER, ACCOUNTABILITY, RULE OF LAW, AND TRANSPARENCY HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT. SINCE, THE POWER DY-NAMICS, ACCOUNTABILITY, RULE OF LAW, AND TRANSPARENCY HAS SUBSTANTIAL IMPLICATIONS ON FINANCIAL AND RELATIONAL GOVERNANCE; THE STUDY SUGGESTS PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING THE RESULTS TO ACHIEVE LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF INLAND CAPTURE AND AQUACULTURE INDUSTRIES IN BANGLADESH.
433	INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE REQUIRES MUTUAL TRUST: A BELIEF THAT THE PARTNER'S LEGAL SYSTEM FUNCTIONS ADEQUATELY AND ADHERES TO FUNDAMENTAL NORMS. THE EUROPEAN UNION BUILDS ITS JUDICIAL-COOPERATION EFFORTS ON A PRESUMPTION OF MUTUAL TRUST: EU MEMBERS ARE ASSUMED TO TRUST EACH OTHER'S JUSTICE SYSTEM SINCE THEY SHARE A COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. SKEPTICS ARGUE, HOWEVER, THAT SUCH TRUST DOES NOT REALLY EXIST GIVEN THE WIDE VARIATION IN LEGAL STANDARDS AND PRACTICES ACROSS EUROPE. YET SUCH SKEPTICISM HAS NOT BEEN SUPPORTED BY SYSTEMATIC EVIDENCE. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO OFFER SUCH EVIDENCE AND TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF THE LACK OF MUTUAL TRUST. IT DOES SO BY EXAMINING THE RECORD OF BRITISH AND IRISH PARTICIPATION IN THE EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANT: A FAST-TRACK PROCESS OF SURRENDER OF FUGITIVES BETWEEN MEMBER STATES. WE FIND THAT JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES IN BRITAIN AND IRELAND DEVIATE FROM THE MUTUAL-TRUST PRESUMPTION: THEY ACCORD A MORE FAVORABLE TREATMENT TO MEMBER STATES WITH A STRONGER RULE OF LAW OR A BETTER HUMAN-RIGHTS RECORD - AND THIS CONSIDERABLY AFFECTS THE RATE OF SURRENDERS. THIS FINDING OFFERS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EU'S JUSTICE POLICY AND FOR UNDERSTANDING COOPERATION AGAINST CRIME MORE BROADLY.
434	ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF CONTEMPORARY STATE PRACTICE IN THE FIELD OF REFUGEE LAW IS THE ATTEMPT BY MANY STATES TO EXCLUDE POTENTIAL REFUGEES FROM THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW BY IMPLEMENTING CREATIVE POLICIES AND PRACTICES DESIGNED TO CREATE 'ZONES OF EXCEPTION'. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES ONE OF THE MOST BLATANT ATTEMPTS AT CREATING A ZONE OF EXCEPTION IN RECENT TIMES, NAMELY, THE CREATION OF MORE THAN 4,891 EXCISED PLACES IN AUSTRALIA IN WHICH THE ORDINARY SAFEGUARDS ENSHRINED IN THE ONSHORE DOMESTIC SYSTEM OF REFUGEE PROTECTION WERE INTENDED TO BE EXCLUDED. THE ARTICLE TRACES THE HISTORY OF THE PURPORTED EXCISION, OUTLINES THE KEY FEATURES OF THE SO-CALLED 'NON-STATUTORY' PROCESS THAT HAS SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN INSTITUTED ON CHRISTMAS ISLAND AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE ONSHORE DOMESTIC SYSTEM OF REFUGEE STATUS DETERMINATION, ASSESSES ITS COMPATIBILITY WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND DESCRIBES AND ANALYSES A RECENT LANDMARK DECISION OF THE HIGH COURT OF AUSTRALIA THAT UNANIMOUSLY AND CATEGORICALLY REJECTED THE NOTION THAT SUCH A SCHEME COULD VALIDLY OPERATE OUTSIDE THE (DOMESTIC) RULE OF LAW. IT CONCLUDES BY CONSIDERING THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS DECISION FOR AUSTRALIA'S CURRENT PROPOSALS FOR A NEW REGIONAL SOLUTION TO ITS PERCEIVED REFUGEE PROBLEM AND, IN PARTICULAR, ITS RECENT 'REFUGEE SWAP' ARRANGEMENT WITH MALAYSIA.
435	THIS ARTICLE DEVELOPS A DITTY-BASED THEORY OF EXECUTIVE POWER. THIS THEORY MAINTAINS THAT THE CONSTITUTION SEEKS TO INSTILL A DUTY IN ALL EXECUTIVE BRANCH OFFICERS TO FAITHFULLY EXECUTE THE LAW. CONVERSELY, THE CONSTITUTION'S FRAMERS AND RATIFIERS DID NOT INTEND TO EMPOWER THE PRESIDENT TO DISTINCTIVELY SHAPE THE LAW TO SUIT HIS POLICY PREFERENCES OR THOSE OF HIS PARTY. RATHER, THEY ENVISIONED A MODEL OF "DISINTERESTED LEADERSHIP" SERVING RULE-OF-LAW VALUES. BECAUSE OF THE RATIFIERS' AND FRAMERS' INTEREST IN PREVENTING ABUSE OF EXECUTIVE POWER, THE CONSTITUTION OBLIGATES EXECUTIVE BRANCH OFFICIALS TO DISOBEY ILLEGAL PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVES AND CREATES A MAJOR CONGRESSIONAL ROLE IN PREVENTING ILLEGAL EXECUTIVE ACTION, PRIMARILY BY ASSIGNING THE SENATE A MAJOR ROLE IN APPOINTMENTS AND REMOVAL. THE DITTY-BASED THEORY FITS ORIGINAL INTENT BETTER THAN THE UNITARY EXECUTIVE THEORY POPULAR THESE DAYS AMONG ORIGINALISTS. BOTH THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT AND THE PRE-ENACTMENT HISTORY SHOW A PREOCCUPATION WITH ESTABLISHING DUTIES, PREVENTING REAL ABUSE, AND SECURING STABLE ADMINISTRATION, RATHER THAN AN EFFORT TO ESTABLISH PRESIDENTIAL CONTROL OVER EXECUTIVE BRANCH DISCRETION. THE DUTY-BASED THEORY ALSO SERVES RULE-OF-LAW VALUES BETTER THAN THE UNITARY EXECUTIVE THEORY. THIS ARTICLE CLOSES WITH A DISCUSSION OF THE THEORY'S IMPLICATIONS FOR KEY SEPARATION OF POWERS ISSUES INVOLVING THE EXECUTION OF LAW.
436	PUBLIC CORRUPTION UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW THAT IS CRUCIAL TO THE MAINTENANCE OF GOVERNMENTAL LEGITIMACY AND PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE. AS POLITICAL DIVISIVENESS HAS GROWN, POLITICIANS HAVE CALLED PUBLIC CORRUPTION INVESTIGATIONS ?WITCH HUNTS? AND PART OF PARTISAN POLITICS, RATHER THAN A SEARCH FOR JUSTICE. CONTEMPORARY ATTACKS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT CHARGE THAT THEY ARE ACTING WITH POLITICAL MOTIVATION WHICH FURTHER UNDERMINES THE LEGITIMACY OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR RESEARCH TO DELVE INTO HOW THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESSES MAINTAIN THEIR FACT-FINDING MISSIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS STUDY ADDRESSES HOW PUBLIC CORRUPTION INVESTIGATIONS OCCUR AND HOW THE INVESTIGATIONS THEMSELVES ARE CONDUCTED. FIRST, FEDERAL PROSECUTION DATA ARE USED TO UNDERSTAND THE FREQUENCY OF INVESTIGATIONS OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. SECOND, INTERVIEWS WITH 40 FORMER INVESTIGATORS AND PROSECUTORS EXAMINES THE PROCESS, PROTOCOLS, TOOLS AND RESOURCES NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL CORRUPTION INVESTIGATIONS. INVESTIGATIONS REQUIRE INTERAGENCY COOPERATION (ESPECIALLY AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT) AND PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE USE OF INVESTIGATIVE TOOLS THAT ENSURE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE LAW IN THE EYES OF THE ACCUSED, THE COURTS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. IN ADDITION, A DECLINE IN PUBLIC CORRUPTION CASES IS SEEN IN RECENT YEARS WITH THE US PROSECUTION EFFORT DIVERTED TO IMMIGRATION CASES.
437	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS - MARKET ECONOMY, FINANCIAL DEEPENING, PRIVATE SECTOR, PROPERTY RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW - AFFECTING THE BANK EFFICIENCY IN CHINA. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - FIRST, PROFIT EFFICIENCY AND COST EFFICIENCY SCORES OF BANKS AT THE FIRM-YEAR LEVEL WERE ESTIMATED USING A STOCHASTIC EFFICIENCY FRONTIER APPROACH. THEN THE RESULTS WERE AGGREGATED AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL. REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS IMPACTING BANK EFFICIENCY WERE EXPLOITED. FINDINGS - IT WAS OBSERVED THAT MOST INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN AFFECTING BANK EFFICIENCY AND ADDITIONALLY BANKS TEND TO OPERATE MORE EFFICIENTLY IN THOSE REGIONS WITH GREATER PRESENCE OF PRIVATE SECTOR AND MORE PROPERTY RIGHTS AWARENESS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE DATA ON A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES SUCH AS PROPERTY RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW ARE NOT EASILY AVAILABLE OR IMPORTANTLY DO NOT VARY THAT MUCH ACROSS YEARS. HOWEVER, BASED ON WHATEVER INFORMATION AVAILABLE, IT IS APPARENT THAT INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IS CRUCIAL TO BANK PERFORMANCE AND ALSO EVENTUAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER IS BELIEVED TO BE THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO EMPIRICALLY EXAMINE THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL FACTOR AFFECTING BANK EFFICIENCY ESPECIALLY IN A TRANSITION COUNTRY.
438	IN INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE, IT IS ARGUED FROM INSTITUTIONAL THEORY THAT ECONOMIC FREEDOM STIMULATES CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY. HOWEVER, ECONOMIC FREEDOM COMPRISES SEVERAL DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS, SUCH AS GOVERNMENT SIZE, RULE OF LAW, OPEN MARKETS, AND (FREEDOM FROM) GOVERNMENT REGULATION. WHEREAS PREVIOUS LITERATURE HAS SHOWN THAT RULE OF LAW AND OPEN MARKETS STIMULATE CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY, THE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT SIZE AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION ON CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY OF COMPANIES LOCATED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES HAS YET NOT BEEN EXPLORED. THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE BY RESEARCHING THE EFFECTS OF THESE TWO DIMENSIONS OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM ON CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT SMALL GOVERNMENT STIMULATES CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT FREEDOM FROM GOVERNMENT REGULATION DISCOURAGES IT. USING PANEL DATA FROM ASSET4 FOR THE CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY OF 5023 COMPANIES, AND DATA OF GOVERNMENT SIZE AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION FROM FRASER INSTITUTE AND HERITAGE FOUNDATION FOR 41 COUNTRIES, THE AUTHORS PERFORM PANEL ANALYSIS FOR THE PERIOD 2005-2014 TO TEST THE HYPOTHESES. THE ESTIMATION RESULTS SHOW THAT BOTH SMALL SIZE OF GOVERNMENT AND FREEDOM FROM GOVERNMENT REGULATION DECREASE CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY. THE TEST RESULTS ARE ROBUST FOR THE TYPE OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM DATA (FRASER INSTITUTE OR HERITAGE FOUNDATION) USED. (C) 2019 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
439	THE POWER-ORIENTED GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE (GATT)/WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) TRADITIONS OF 'MEMBER-DRIVEN GOVERNANCE' RISK UNDERMINING THE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT SYSTEM OF THE WTO AND ITS JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. US PRESIDENT TRUMP, THE 'BREXIT', AND NON-DEMOCRATIC RULERS CHALLENGE MULTILATERAL TREATIES AND JUDICIAL SYSTEMS BY 'POPULIST PROTECTIONISM' PRIORITIZING 'BILATERAL DEALS'. THIS CONTRIBUTION USES THE EXAMPLE OF THE US BLOCKAGE OF THE WTO APPELLATE BODY SYSTEM FOR ILLUSTRATING THE 'REPUBLICAN ARGUMENT' WHY PUBLIC GOODS (PGS, RES PUBLICA) CANNOT BE LEGITIMATELY PROTECTED WITHOUT JUDICIAL REMEDIES, RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE. ADVERSELY AFFECTED GOVERNMENTS, CITIZENS, AND COURTS OF JUSTICE MUST HOLD POWER POLITICS MORE ACCOUNTABLE AND PUBLICLY CHALLENGE ILLEGAL WTO PRACTICES SO AS TO PROTECT TRANSNATIONAL 'AGGREGATE PGS' (LIKE THE WTO TRADING AND LEGAL SYSTEM) FOR THE BENEFIT OF CITIZENS. WTO MEMBERS SHOULD USE THEIR POWER OF MAJORITY VOTING FOR AUTHORITATIVE INTERPRETATIONS OF WTO LAW SUPPORTING 'JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE' IN MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE OF THE WORLD TRADING SYSTEM. MULTILEVEL JUDICIAL CONTROL OF TRADE REGULATION LEGITIMIZES 'MEMBER-DRIVEN GOVERNANCE' BY PROTECTING RULE OF LAW AS APPROVED BY PARLIAMENTS WHEN THEY AUTHORIZED RATIFICATION OF THE WTO AGREEMENT AND ITS LEGAL IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE BENEFIT OF CITIZENS, THEIR EQUAL RIGHTS AND SOCIAL WELFARE.
440	SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE-TO-LAND RELATIONSHIPS EXIST IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. THEY CONSTITUTE A BARRIER TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. TO REGISTER THESE RELATIONSHIPS, A PARADIGM SHIFT IS REQUIRED. INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING TRADITIONAL, FORMAL, COSTLY, AND TIME-CONSUMING WORKFLOWS, THE FOCUS SHOULD BE ON SIMPLE, FLEXIBLE, SCALABLE, AFFORDABLE, INCLUSIVE, PARTICIPATORY, RELIABLE, ATTAINABLE, UPGRADEABLE, COMMUNITY-BASED, AND STANDARDS-COMPLIANT METHODS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT SUPPORT LAND REGISTRATION. CONVENTIONALLY, COLLECTION OF LAND DATA IS CARRIED OUT BY SPECIALISTS WHO USE SOPHISTICATED SURVEY EQUIPMENT AND HIGHLY ELABORATED ATTRIBUTE FORMS, WITH CRITERIA BASED ON REGULATIONS WHICH COMMONLY FOCUS ON THE FULFILMENT OF TECHNICAL STANDARDS. TO ACHIEVE DOCUMENTED LAND RIGHTS FOR ALL, REVOLUTIONARY APPROACHES ARE REQUIRED THAT PRODUCE LAND ADMINISTRATION MORE RAPIDLY AND EFFICIENTLY THAN WHAT PRESENT PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS CAN DELIVER TODAY. DATA ACQUISITION PROCEDURES MUST CHANGE, BE SIMPLE, COMPLY WITH SOCIETAL NEEDS, SUPPORT DATA COLLECTION BY CITIZENS AND ALLOW PROPER SCALING OUT. OUR SOLUTION HAS THE FUNCTIONAL ABILITY TO COLLECT DATA BASED ON A PREDEFINED DATA MODEL THAT CAPTURES REQUIRED CHARACTERISTICS AND CONSTRAINTS ASSOCIATED WITH LAND REGISTRATION. LANDOWNERS AND OTHER RIGHTHOLDERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS CAN COLLECT THE DATA THEMSELVES UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND GUIDANCE OF LAND PROFESSIONALS. TO REALISE THIS SOLUTION, WE WORKED WITH ESRI, THE LEADING GIS INDUSTRY SOLUTIONS PROVIDER. WE USE A CELL PHONE APP CONNECTED TO AN EXTERNAL GPS RECEIVER TO COLLECT POLYGONS AS THE PRIMARY SPATIAL ELEMENT TO REPRESENT LAND UNITS. THIS CONFIGURATION SILENTLY REGISTERS ACCURACY DATA ON THE SURVEYED VERTICES OF THE POLYGON. THIS DATA IS NEEDED FOR THE GENERATION OF A CADASTRAL DATA SET DURING POSTPROCESSING. DURING THE SURVEY, GEOMETRIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE DATA ARE COLLECTED SIMULTANEOUSLY. ALL TYPES OF PEOPLE-TO-LAND RELATIONSHIPS CAN BE CAPTURED: FORMAL, INFORMAL, CUSTOMARY, ETC. SINCE THE COMMUNITY ACTIVELY PARTICIPATES IN THE DATA COLLECTION, SEVERAL ACTIVITIES ARE ORGANIZED BY LAND PROFESSIONALS TO ENSURE THAT PREDEFINED METHODOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS ARE MET. THE PARTICIPATION OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY ALSO RESULTS IN A GENDER-FRIENDLY PROCEDURE. SINCE EVERY LANDOWNER/ RIGHTHOLDER SURVEYS HER/HIS OWN LAND, BOUNDARIES BETWEEN NEIGHBORING PARCELS ARE COLLECTED TWICE. IN PRACTICE THIS MAY LEAD TO GAPS AND OVERLAPS BETWEEN THE SURVEYED SPATIAL UNITS. A CUSTOMIZED LIBRARY OF FUNCTIONS IS USED THAT TRANSFORMS SURVEYED DATA INTO TOPOLOGICALLY VALID REPRESENTATIONS OF REAL-WORLD SPATIAL UNITS IN A SEMI AUTOMATED WAY. SUBSEQUENT COMMUNITY VALIDATION IS ORGANISED IN A PUBLIC EVENT WHERE NEIGHBOR LANDOWNERS/ RIGHTHOLDERS CHECK AND APPROVE THEIR SHARED BOUNDARY WITH A DIGITAL SIGNATURE OR A DIGITAL FINGERPRINT. AUTHORITIES ALSO USE THE PUBLIC EVENT TO CHECK AND VALIDATE IDENTITIES, NEIGHBORING RELATIONSHIPS AND SUPPORTING EVIDENCE. JUST LIKE THE DATA COLLECTION, THE DATA VALIDATION PROCEDURE REQUIRES ROBUST BUT SIMPLE TECHNOLOGY. THE LAST STEP IN THE PROCESS LEADS TO THE RECORDATION OF VARIOUS PEOPLE-TO-LAND RELATIONSHIPS IN THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS. DURING LEGAL ANALYSIS, THE EVIDENCE PROVIDED BY CITIZENS IS COMBINED WITH THE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE IN THE GOVERNMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS TO DETERMINE THE OFFICIAL TYPE OF RIGHT FOR EACH RELATIONSHIP. GOVERNMENTAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS NEED TO BE ADAPTED TO PROPERLY STORE A FULL CONTINUUM OF RIGHTS, WHICH IN TURN REQUIRES NEW LEGISLATION TO BE IN PLACE. IN THIS WAY, THE GOVERNMENT OBTAINS A COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW OF THE STATUS OF LAND RIGHTS, WHICH ALLOWS BETTER PLANNING AND DECISION-MAKING. AND IT EMPOWERS THE GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT CITIZEN LAND RIGHTS. THE SYSTEM USES A MULTI-LEVEL DATA MODEL BASED ON THE LAND ADMINISTRATION DOMAIN MODEL (LADM). THESE LEVELS ARE: DATA COLLECTION, POST-PROCESSING, VALIDATION, AND RECORDATION. THE DATA COMPLIES FULLY WITH THE LADM STANDARD AND WITH THE CORRESPONDING COUNTRY PROFILE. A NUMBER OF AREAS IN COLOMBIA WITH DIFFERENT LAND RIGHTS STRUCTURES HAVE BEEN USED AS CASE STUDY FOR EXPERIMENTAL AND VALIDATION PURPOSES.
441	POLITICAL TRUST IN GOVERNMENTS AND POLITICAL ORGANS IS A SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANT OF LEGITIMACY. THIS QUANTITATIVE STUDY, USING SURVEY AND QUESTIONNAIRE, HAS STUDIED AND INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF TWO VARIABLES OF THE STATE'S GOVERNING METHOD AND PERFORMANCE, AS WELL AS SOFT POWER ON STUDENTS' POLITICAL TRUST. THE SAMPLE OF THE STUDY INCLUDED 400 BACHELOR'S AND MASTER'S STUDENTS STUDYING AT SHIRAZ UNIVERSITY. THE RESULT REVEALED A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP STUDENTS' USE OF DOMESTIC MEDIA AND TRUSTING THEIR CONTENTS AND THEIR POLITICAL TRUST ON THE GOVERNMENT AND THE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS. THERE WAS A NEGATIVE AND INVERSE RELATION WHEN IT CAME TO THE INTERNET AND SATELLITE CHANNELS. IN TERMS OF GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (INCLUDING SENSE OF SECURITY, NOTION OF RULE OF LAW, SERVICES, ACCOUNTABILITY AND POLITICAL EFFECTIVENESS) AND POLITICAL TRUST, A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WAS OBSERVED. HOWEVER, AN INVERSE AND SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP WAS SEEN BETWEEN THE THOUGHT THAT THERE'S DISCRIMINATION AND CORRUPTION AND POLITICAL TRUST. THE MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE VARIABLES NAMELY TRUST IN NEWS OF LOCAL MEDIA, NOTION OF CORRUPTION IN INSTITUTIONS, NOTION OF ACCOUNTABILITY, RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPERVISION IN THE GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION, SENSE OF SECURITY, NOTION OF RULE OF LAW, AND SEX (BEING MAN), TOTALLY EXPLAINED 49.7% OF CHANGES IN POLITICAL TRUST.
442	THIS ARTICLE TAKES AS ITS PRINCIPAL QUESTION WHETHER THE RUSSIAN PROTECTION OF FREEDOM OF RELIGION IN LAW AND PRACTICE IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE MODEL CREATED BY STRASBOURG JURISPRUDENCE. CONSIDERING FREEDOM OF RELIGION AS A KEYSTONE OF THE STRASBOURG MODEL OF DEMOCRACY AND IN LIGHT OF INCREASING CONCERN AND UNCERTAINTY AT DEMOCRATIC PROGRESS IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, THE ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO ISOLATE THE REALITIES OF THE SITUATION IN RELATION TO THIS UNIQUE RIGHT. IT CONSIDERS BOTH SYSTEMS IN LAW AND THEIR OPERATION IN A BROADER SOCIAL CONTEXT AND FINALLY CONSIDERS ISSUES OF COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN THEM. IN ITS CONCLUSION, THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT, ALTHOUGH THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION'S LEGAL FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHES A SIMILAR MODEL OF PROTECTION TO THAT OF STRASBOURG, THIS FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN MANIPULATED AND DIMINISHED IN IMPORTANCE BY, AND BECAUSE OF, EXTRALEGAL RELATIONSHIPS (PARTICULARLY BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH) TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY THAT THE SYSTEMS ARE COMPATIBLE. FURTHER, THE AUTHOR SUGGESTS THAT THE FACT THAT THESE EXTRALEGAL RELATIONSHIPS CAN PLAY SUCH A ROLE SHOWS DEEP FISSURES IN THE RULE OF LAW IN THIS AREA. THIS IS INDICATIVE OF WIDER PROBLEMS RELATING TO DOMESTIC RULE OF LAW GENERALLY AND IS THEREFORE INDICATIVE OF PROBLEMS RELATING TO FOUNDATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES.
443	THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ANALYSE THE USE OF WAR METAPHORS IN THE DISCOURSE BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND POLAND ON THE RULE OF LAW IN POLAND. THE STUDY IS BASED ON THE METHODOLOGY OF DISCURSIVE LINGUISTIC COMPARISON DEVELOPED BY THE DUSSELDORF SCHOOL AND LAKOFF AND JOHNSON'S THEORY OF CONCEPTUAL METAPHOR. THE ANALYSIS CONFIRMS TWO POSITIONS IN THE APPROACH TO THE DISPUTE OVER RELATIONS BETWEEN POLAND AND THE EUROPEAN UNION.
444	THIS STUDY USES GLOBAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP MONITOR (GEM) AND WORLD BANK GROUP ENTREPRENEURSHIP SURVEY DATA FROM 40 COUNTRIES FROM 2002 TO 2008 TO EXAMINE THE LINKAGE BETWEEN GOVERNANCE MATTERS AND ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITIES. BASED ON THE CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF GEM AND BY USING FIXED-EFFECTS PANEL ANALYSIS, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION ARE HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANTS OF ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITIES.

445	RUSSIA IN 2007 MOVED FURTHER AWAY FROM A CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW AS PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN'S SECOND TERM DREW TO A CLOSE AND THE COUNTRY PREPARED FOR PARLIAMENTARY AND PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. HIGH OIL AND GAS PRICES BUOYED THE ECONOMY, BUT LITTLE PROGRESS WAS MADE IN ADDRESSING RUSSIA'S SERIOUS SOCIAL PROBLEMS. IN FOREIGN POLICY, CONFRONTATION WITH THE WEST WAS BALANCED BY EXCELLENT RELATIONS WITH MOST OF ASIA.
446	THE INSTITUTE FOR THE RULE OF LAW TOGETHER WITH CENTRE FOR STRATEGIC RESEARCH HAS WRITTEN "A NEW QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY MANIFESTO: EVIDENCE BASED CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICYMAKING". THIS PAPER STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND APPROACHES TO DATA ANALYSIS IN CRIMINOLOGY RESEARCH GEARED TOWARD EVIDENCE-BASED POLICYMAKING. THIS MANIFESTO DEMONSTRATES HOW QUANTITATIVE METHODS CAN BE USED TO GET NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE NATURE OF CRIME AND THE FORMULATION OF RUSSIAN CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICY.
447	HUNGARY, THE FORMER "LABORATORY OF SOCIALISM", HAS BECOME A "LABORATORY OF DEMOCRACY". SOME OBSERVERS FEAR THAT ACHIEVEMENTS SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY ARE UP FOR NEGOTIATION. THAT IS AN EXAGGERATION. HUNGARY HAS A PLURALISTIC POLITICAL LANDSCAPE WITH A DIVERSE ELECTORATE, AMONG WHICH VIKTOR ORBAN'S FIDESZ STILL ENJOYS BROAD BACKING. BUT THIS SUPPORT IS CRUMBLING. THE CRUCIAL QUESTION IS WHETHER FIDESZ SUCCEEDS IN REORGANISING THE ECONOMY AND MODERNISING HUNGARY.
448	A SERIES OF REGULATIONS AND ORDINANCES ARE CONSCIOUSLY DISOBEYED BY THIS INTERVENTION. ITS TRANSGRESSIVE CHARACTER, HOWEVER, WAS OVERCOME BY THE EVENTS OF OCTOBER 18, 2019, IN CHILE, WHICH EVEN LED THE GOVERNMENT TO DECLARE A STATE OF CONSTITUTIONAL EXCEPTION, THAT IS, A TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THUS, BOTH THIS PROJECT AND THE POLITICAL CONTEXT THAT DETERMINED IT, OPEN THE SAME QUESTION: TO WHAT EXTENT CAN A TEMPORARY INTERVENTION HAVE PERMANENT CONSEQUENCES?
449	KLEIST'S LAST DRAMA INTRODUCES HOMBURG AS TRANSCENDENTAL, POLITICAL, AND THEOLOGICAL REDEEMER SUPPOSED TO UNITE NATURE AND LAW IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH BRANDENBURG AS A PATRIOTIC STATE FOUNDED ON THE RULE OF LAW OR GOD'S HOLY KINGDOM ON EARTH. IT HAS NOT BEEN SEEN THAT AS IN OTHERS OF KLEIST'S POETIC WORKS, THE BIBLICAL PATTERN REFLECTS UPON THE PASSION OF CHRIST, EVEN THOUGH THE TEXT MAINTAINS KANTIAN DOUBT AS TO METAPHYSICAL KNOWLEDGE.
450	IN 2012, HONG KONG MARKED THE FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HANDOVER OF SOVEREIGNTY FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA. IN THIS ESSAY, MARTIN S. FLAHERTY GIVES AN OVERVIEW OF THE HANDOVER PROCESS, DISCUSSES ITS IMPACT ON THE HONG KONG JUDICIARY, AND PROVIDES AN INTRODUCTION TO THE THEMES DISCUSSED BY JUSTICE KEMAL BOKHARY IN HIS ESSAY "THE RULE OF LAW IN HONG KONG FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE HANDOVER."
451	THE DEBATE BETWEEN STATUTORY-BASED POSITIVISM AND NEOCONSTITUTIONALISM IS NOT NEW, BUT NEITHER CAN IT BE CONSIDERED SUPERSEDED. THIS PAPER ATTEMPTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO SUCH DEBATE ON THE SIDE OF STATUTORY-BASED POSITIVISM AS A THEORY THAT ALLOWS US TO DEFEND TO A GREATER EXTENT THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND, ULTIMATELY, HUMAN FREEDOM. TO THIS END, THE PAPER SUGGESTS WE SHOULD ABANDON THE USE OF CERTAIN TERMS THAT ENDANGER THESE PRINCIPLES.
452	THIS STUDY PROPOSE A NEW READING OF CONSTITUCIONAL LAW ABOUT THE EXTENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION FROM THE NATIONAL AND GLOBAL SYSTEMS. SO THERE IS THE INTENTION FOR ANALYZING HOW THE CONNECTION BETWEEN GEOPOLITICS AND LAW CAN ASSURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT AND THE APPLICABLE INFRACONSTITUTIONAL LEGISLATION. THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THERE IS SUFFICIENT NORMATIVE LATITUDE IN THE CONSTITUTION TO RESPOND TO THE CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY THE POST-MODERN RULE OF LAW.
453	THIS ARTICLE, THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF LEGAL AND SOCIOLOGICAL ABOUT THE PROCESS OF EVOLUTION OF CONSTITUTIONALISM, WHICH CAUSED THE EMERGENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW ON THE CONCEPT OF RESPECT FOR THE HIERARCHY OF NORMS AND THE OFFICE OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS, AIMS TO DEMONSTRATE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, IN PARTICULAR LABOR (OWN WORK AND, MORE SPECIFICALLY, EMPLOYMENT), REPRESENT TRUE PILLARS OF SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENT OF DEMOCRACY, BUILT IN PARALLEL THROUGH FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.
454	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SIX WORLD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS AND FOREIGN PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT IN 33 SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN (SSA) COUNTRIES OVER THE YEARS OF 1998-2015. GMM ANALYSIS FINDS THAT PORTFOLIO INFLOWS ARE MOST SIGNIFICANTLY ATTRACTED BY THE ABILITY OF SSA GOVERNMENTS TO IMPLEMENT POLICIES EFFECTIVELY, STRENGTHENING THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS, AND CONTROLLING CORRUPTION; BUT ARE DETERRED BY THE REGIONS POOR RECORD OF THE RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL STABILITY.
455	WE OUGHT TO BE RELUCTANT TO THINK OF THESE EARLY [ENGLISH AND WELSH] KINGS AS INTENTIONALLY OR EVEN CONSCIOUSLY CREATING NEW LAW, ALTHOUGH THEIR WORK, SEEN IN THE LIGHT OF OUR OWN IDEA OF LAW, LOOKS LIKE LEGISLATION AND ALTHOUGH IT MAY HAVE BEEN GIVEN SOME TEMPORARY PUBLICITY AS THE RULER'S WILL. FOR THE EARLIER KINGS AT LEAST, ANY STATEMENT OF A RULE OF LAW WAS A DECLARATION OF WHAT HAD ALWAYS BEEN LAW.
456	FOR YEARS, JADWIGA STANISZKIS WAS THE MOST FAMOUS INTELLECTUAL WITHIN THE KACZYNSKI CAMP. NOW, IN CONVERSATION WITH GERHARD GNAUCK, SHE IS OFFERING HARSH CRITICISM: JAROSLAW KACZYNSKI AND HIS RULING PARTY LAW AND JUSTICE ARE SUBJUGATING THE PEOPLE, SHOWING AN ALMOST BOLSHEVIK UNDERSTANDING OF LAW, AND DAMAGING THE RULE OF LAW. AS A RESULT OF LAW AND JUSTICE POLICIES, THE DISTANCE BETWEEN POLAND AND WESTERN EUROPE IS GROWING. POLAND IS MOVING FARTHER TO THE EAST.
457	IT WAS NOT BY CHANCE THAT THE POWER OF AMENDMENT WAS BORN WITH THE FIRST DEMOCRATIC AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTION IN HISTORY. ITS EXPRESS RECOGNITION AROSE NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF TENSIONS BETWEEN THE MINORITY AND THE MAJORITY, BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO ARTICULATE A FORMULA OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE PEOPLES OF THE STATES AND THE FEDERAL NATION. THIS LATTER PERSPECTIVE IS WHAT THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES, FROM TWO FUNDAMENTAL AXES. THE FIRST IS BASED ON THE IDEA THE CONSTITUTIONAL RECOGNITION OF THE POWER OF AMENDMENT REPLACES THE CLASSICAL RIGHT OF REBELLION - WHICH BECAME A RIGHT TO SECESSION - OF MEMBER STATES WITH A 'CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO BLOCK REFORM', ONE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF FEDERAL STATES. THE SECOND AXIS OF ANALYSIS IS LINKED TO THE AFFIRMATION THAT THE STATE IS A REALITY THAT PRECEDES AND CONDITIONS THE CONSTITUTION AS A LAW, WHICH IS WHY IMPLICIT LIMITS MAY BE INFERRED TO THE POWER OF AMENDMENT FROM THIS PRE-EXISTENCE.
458	IN RUSSIA, NUMEROUS UKRAINIAN CITIZENS HAVE BEEN TRIED IN COURT SINCE THE START OF THE WAR AGAINST UKRAINE. MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN GIVEN LONG PRISON SENTENCES. THE TRIALS MAKE A MOCKERY OF ANY RULE OF LAW. THEY HAVE BEEN MARKED BY ARBITRARY DECISIONS, PRESUMPTION OF GUILT AND FORCED CONFESSIONS. AS WAS THE CASE DURING THE SOVIET ERA, THE UNWRITTEN RULES AND PRACTICES OF A POLITICIZED JUDICIAL SYSTEM OVERRIDE THE OFFICIAL CONSTITUTION.
459	INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMARY LAW REQUIRES INTERPRETING TREATIES AND SETTLING RELATED DISPUTES 'IN CONFORMITY WITH PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE' AND THE HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS OF STATES. YET, IN CONTRAST TO UN LAW, EUROPEAN ECONOMIC LAW AND RELATED ADJUDICATION BY THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE (ICJ) AND EUROPEAN COURTS, INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS AND RELATED ADJUDICATION TEND TO AVOID REFERENCES TO 'PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE' AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS CONTRIBUTION ARGUES FOR A MORE COHERENT 'JUDICIAL METHODOLOGY' IN MULTILEVEL ECONOMIC ADJUDICATION IN ORDER TO PROMOTE 'JUDICIAL COMITY' AND TRANSNATIONAL RULE OF LAW FOR THE BENEFIT OF CITIZENS. AS THE INCORPORATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS INTO POSITIVE INTERNATIONAL LAW ENTAILS THE RECOGNITION OF INDIVIDUALS AS LEGAL SUBJECTS, JUDICIAL REGARD TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND OTHER 'PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE' IS INDISPENSABLE FOR DETERMINING THE 'OBJECT AND PURPOSE' OF MODERN INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW (IEL) (I). BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE 'DUAL NATURE' OF MODERN LEGAL SYSTEMS (II) AND THE COMMON CORE OF 'PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE' UNDERLYING MULTILEVEL GUARANTEES OF EQUAL FREEDOMS AND SOVEREIGN RIGHTS TO PROTECT PUBLIC INTERESTS, ECONOMIC ADJUDICATION COULD BECOME MORE LEGITIMATE AND MORE COHERENT (III). THE 'METHODOLOGICAL INDIVIDUALISM' UNDERLYING HUMAN RIGHTS LAW (HRL) AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACIES JUSTIFIES A PRESUMPTION OF CONCEPTUALIZING PRIVATE AND PUBLIC ECONOMIC REGULATION AS INTEGRAL PARTS OF IEL AIMED AT PROTECTING REASONABLE SELF-INTERESTS AND EQUAL RIGHTS OF CITIZENS (IV). THE 'CONSISTENT INTERPRETATION PRINCIPLE' RECOGNIZED IN NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEMS CONFIRMS THE NEED FOR 'DE-FRAGMENTING IEL' BASED ON 'NORMATIVE INDIVIDUALISM' (V). ECONOMIC ADJUDICATION DERIVES ITS CONSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY FROM PROTECTING 'CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE' AS A CONSTITUTIVE PRINCIPLE NOT ONLY OF HRL BUT ALSO OF MODERN TRADE AND INVESTMENT ADJUDICATION (VI) IT REQUIRES RESPECT FOR LEGITIMATE 'CONSTITUTIONAL PLURALISM' (VII) AND TRANSNATIONAL COOPERATION AMONG COURTS SO AS TO PROTECT RULE OF LAW NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF RIGHTS OF GOVERNMENTS BUT ALSO FOR THE BENEFIT OF PRIVATE ECONOMIC ACTORS (VIII). JUDICIAL RULE-CLARIFICATION (IX) AND JUDICIAL 'SYSTEM BUILDING' ARE NECESSARY PARTS OF JUDICIAL PROTECTION OF TRANSNATIONAL RULE OF LAW SO AS TO IMPROVE THE 'INCOMPLETE', FRAGMENTED AND OFTEN POWER-DRIVEN IEL SYSTEM FOR THE BENEFIT OF CITIZENS AS THE ULTIMATE SOURCES OF VALUES AND DEMOCRATIC OWNERS OF GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS (X).
460	SECTION 139 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF SOUTH AFRICA EMPOWERS PROVINCES TO INTERVENE INTO MUNICIPALITIES, AN INSTRUMENT TO CORRECT SERIOUS FAILURES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE POLICY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR INTERVENTIONS AND ASSESSES WHETHER THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS THAT CIRCUMSCRIBE IT, ARE BEING ADHERED TO. THE STARTING POINT IS THAT DECENTRALISATION, OF WHICH THIS INSTRUMENT IS PART, IS RULES-BASED AND THAT ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW IS CRITICAL FOR ITS SUCCESS. BY ITS VERY NATURE, INTERVENTION REPRESENTS AN INTRUSION INTO THE INSTITUTIONAL INTEGRITY OF THE AFFECTED MUNICIPALITY AND ADHERENCE TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS SURROUNDING THE INTERVENTION IS THEREFORE CRITICAL. THE ARTICLE SETS OUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR INTERVENTIONS INTO MUNICIPALITIES WHICH INCLUDES OVERSIGHT ROLES FOR THE MINISTER RESPONSIBLE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT, THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF PROVINCES AND THE PROVINCIAL LEGISLATURE. IT COMBINES THIS WITH AN ASSESSMENT OF 39 INTERVENTIONS THAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN 2008 AND 2014. IT PRESENTS A PROVINCIAL BREAKDOWN AND A BREAKDOWN OF THE LEGAL BASIS OF THESE 39 INTERVENTIONS. IT CONCLUDES THAT PROVINCES DON'T USE THE INTERVENTIONS ENVISAGED IN SECTION 139(4) AND (5) BUT INSTEAD ALMOST ALWAYS INTERVENE IN TERMS OF SECTION 139(1) OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE INTERVENTIONS ARE ASSESSED FOR COMPLIANCE WITH CONSTITUTIONAL PRESCRIPTS, SUCH AS THE NEED TO ESTABLISH A FAILURE TO FULFIL AN EXECUTIVE OBLIGATION, THE TIMELY SUBMISSION OF THE INTERVENTION TO THE MINISTER AND THE NCOP AND THEIR TIMELY APPROVAL. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF INTERVENTIONS DID NOT COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS PERTAINING TO THE TIMELY SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL BY THE MINISTER AND THE NCOP. FURTHERMORE, THERE IS A NEED TO ACCELERATE THE ADOPTION OF THE LEGISLATION ENVISAGED BY SECTION 139(8) OF THE CONSTITUTION TO FURTHER REGULATE INTERVENTIONS.
461	THIS ESSAY ANALYZES THE RESPONSE OF ONE OF AMERICA'S PRE-EMINENT JUDGES, HENRY FRIENDLY, TO ONE OF THE MOST FAR REACHING CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS OF HIS TIME AND OUR TIME, THE INCORPORATION OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS INTO THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT'S DUE PROCESS CLAUSE. IN THE COURSE OF ADDRESSING THE ISSUE, FRIENDLY RAISED PROFOUND CONCERNS ABOUT CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTRUCTION, FEDERALISM, THE RULE OF LAW, AND INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY THAT CONTINUE TO RESONATE DECADES LATER.
462	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE IMPORTANCE OF RULE OF LAW VALUES SUCH AS PREDICTABILITY, CERTAINTY, EQUALITY, AND PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS IN CONTROLLING CORRUPTION AT THE MUNICIPAL LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT AND HOW THOSE VALUES ARE BEING REPLACED BY POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC VALUES SUCH AS EFFICIENCY, DISCRETION, RESPONSIVENESS, AND NEED. PARTICULAR ATTENTION IS PLACED ON HOW THIS CHANGE IN VALUES MAY LEAD TO CORRUPTION AND ABUSE OF POWER IN PLANNING AND OTHER DECISIONS MADE BY MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS.
463	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF UTILISING AN EXTRA STATUTORY CONCESSION POWER (ESCP) IN AUSTRALIAS COMMONWEALTH TAX LEGISLATION AND SUGGESTS THE KEY COMPONENTS FOR ESTABLISHING A STATUTORY ESCP. THE DEBATE REGARDING THE USE OF ESCPS RAISES FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES REGARDING THE USE OF DISCRETION WITHIN A REVENUE ACT, THE AMOUNT OF DISCRETIONARY POWER THAT SHOULD BE VESTED IN AN ADMINISTRATOR AND THE ISSUES AN ESCP PRESENTS IN RELATION TO THE RULE OF LAW.
464	NOWADAYS, MAN HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED FROM ANIMAL RATIONALE AND ANIMAL SYMBOLICUM INTO HOMO VIDENS, AND THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS DETERMINES THE TOOLS AT THE DISPOSAL OF RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS TO CARRY OUT THE WORK OF NEW EVANGELISATION, TO CONTEST GLOBAL SECULARISATION, OR TO POINT OUT THE CORRECT MORAL SOLUTIONS FROM A CHRISTIAN POINT OF VIEW TO THE PROBLEMS OF TODAY'S CIVILISATION. RELIGIOUS ADVERTISING IS JUST SUCH A NEW TOOL OF INFORMATION AND PERSUASION. IT IS ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF COMMUNICATION AIMED AT PROMOTING VALUES, IDEAS, SERVICES AND SHAPING ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOURS APPROPRIATE TO A GIVEN RELIGION. IT CONTAINS CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE SACRUM AND AIMS TO MAKE RECIPIENTS AWARE OF THEIR SPIRITUAL NEEDS, AROUSE THE DESIRE TO SATISFY THEM AND INDICATE THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF CHRISTIANITY. IT IS SUPPOSED TO CREATE APPROPRIATE PREFERENCES, SHOW THE BEAUTY AND POSITIVE IMAGE OF THE SENDER AND THE "PRODUCT" THAT FAITH PROVIDES. A SPECIFIC TYPE OF ADVERTISING IS A BILLBOARD CAMPAIGN. POLAND IS THE MOST CATHOLIC COUNTRY IN EUROPE. AT THE SAME TIME, IT RANKS FIRST IN TERMS OF THE RATE OF SECULARISATION AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE. IN POLAND, AT THE TURN OF 2020/2021, WE HAD AN ANTI-ABORTION BILLBOARD CAMPAIGN, WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF THE LONG-STANDING POLICY OF THE CONSERVATIVE RULING CAMP AGAINST VARIOUS FORMS OF CONTEMPORARY SECULARISATION AND GLOBAL SECULAR IDEOLOGIES. THE CAMPAIGN PROVED TO BE CONTROVERSIAL AND INEFFECTIVE. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO DESCRIBE THE SPECIFICS OF SOCIAL ADVERTISING IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ISSUES DISCUSSED ON THE EXAMPLE OF THE POLISH ANTI-ABORTION CAMPAIGN.
465	THIS ESSAY OFFERS A CRITICAL REASSESSMENT OF REVISIONISM FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A SPECIALIST ON THE LATER SEVENTEENTH CENTURY WHO HAS RECENTLY MOVED BACK TO WORK ON THE EARLY STUART PERIOD. IT ADDRESSES THREE BROAD AREAS - THE QUESTION OF IDEOLOGICAL CONSENSUS IN PRE-CIVIL WAR ENGLAND, THE NATURE OF THE EARLY STUART CHURCH, AND THE SOCIAL DEPTH OF POLITICS. INCORPORATING SCOTLAND AND IRELAND AS WELL AS ENGLAND, IT HIGHLIGHTS HOW SCHOLARSHIP BY LATER-STUART HISTORIANS AND BY THOSE WORKING ON "HISTORY FROM BELOW" EXPOSED THE LIMITATIONS OF REVISIONISM, AND IT POINTS TO THE NEED TO SEEK LONG-TERM EXPLANATIONS FOR THE ORIGINS OF THE ENGLISH CIVIL WAR.
466	CONSIDERING THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO LIFE OF THE CONCEIVED, THIS PAPER SHOWS THE ANTINOMY THAT ARISES BETWEEN TWO CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS: A DOMESTIC NORM CREATED BY THE PERU-VIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, AND AN INTERNATIONAL NORM CREATED BY THE INTER-AMERICAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS. BOTH NORMS MADE UP THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTENT OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO LIFE. ONCE THE ANTINOMY HAS BEEN RAISED, IT IS PROPOSED TO SOLVE IT FROM THE DOGMATIC BASES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE OF LAW, WHICH PROHIBITS THAT THE SOLUTION BE EXCLUSIVELY SUSTAINED ON REASONS OF AUTHORITY. THUS, IT IS JUSTIFIED TO RESOLVE IT NOT FROM A RELATIONSHIP OF SUPREMACY OF THE CONVENTIONAL LAW OVER THE DOMESTIC, BUT FROM AN EFFECTIVE RELATIONSHIP OF COMPLEMENTARITY FOR THE EFFECTIVE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE FULL REALIZATION OF THE PEOPLE THROUGH THE FULL ENFORCEMENT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS. SUCH A SOLUTION REPRESENTS, AT THE SAME TIME, REASONABLE LIMITS TO THE CONTROL OF CONVENTIONALITY IN THE HANDS OF THE INTER-AMERICAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND PROMOTES AN EFFECTIVE DIALOGUE BETWEEN IT AND THE NATIONAL COURTS OF JUSTICE.
467	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE INFLUENCE OF BANKRUPTCY COURTS ON THE RISK-TAKING BEHAVIOR OF LISTED FIRMS IN CHINA BETWEEN 2002 AND 2019. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF BANKRUPTCY COURTS DISCOURAGES LISTED FIRMS FROM TAKING EXCESSIVE RISK. THIS EFFECT IS MORE PRONOUNCED IN FIRMS WITH FINANCING CONSTRAINTS, HIGH MARKET VALUATIONS, AND THOSE OPERATING IN REGIONS WITH A WEAKER RULE OF LAW. OVERALL, OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT ESTABLISHING BANKRUPTCY COURTS BENEFITS CREDITORS' RIGHTS AND RESTRAINS CORPORATE RISK-TAKING.
468	THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE PROCESSES OF FORMATION OF PROPERTY RELATIONS IN RUSSIA DURING THE PRIVATIZATION, IDENTIFIES THE PROBLEM OF TRANSFORMATION OF PROPERTY RELATIONS IN THE TRANSITION FROM A PLANNED TO A MARKET ECONOMY. AUTHOR DEALS WITH THE ROLE OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC PROPERTY IN THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY. SHE ALSO IDENTIFIES THE MAIN POINTS RELEVANT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OWNERSHIP RELATIONS ON THE ROAD TO A MARKET ECONOMY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
469	THIS ARTICLE, A PRODUCT OF THE RESEARCH PROJECT, THE IMPACT OF PENSION REFORM UNDER THE RULE OF LAW AIMS TO EXAMINE THE THEORETICAL ARGUMENTS THAT ALLOW US TO CONSIDER THE RIGHT TO SOCIAL SECURITY AND PENSION GENERALLY AS A NON-NEGOTIABLE SOCIAL RIGHT. IT IS A CONTRIBUTION TO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF SOCIAL RIGHTS, WHICH HAS DEVELOPED IN RECENT DECADES FROM THE IDEAS OF RENOWNED AUTHORS IN THE FIELD.
470	THE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE POLITICAL SYSTEM AND THE SHAPE OF CRIMINAL LAW SOLUTIONS IN THE PERIOD OF A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM IN THE MODEL SYSTEM - IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONCEPT PROPOSED BY THE AUTHOR - ARE AS FOLLOWS: CHANGE OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM, INTRODUCTION INTO THE POLITICAL SYSTEM OF LEGAL ACTS WHICH VALIDATE IT IN THE BASIC SCOPE, ADOPTION OF A PROVISIONAL CONSTITUTION, ADOPTION OF A BASIC LAW (FORMALLY CHANGING THE STATE SYSTEM), ADOPTION OF CODE SOLUTIONS IN THE AREA OF SUBSTANTIVE CRIMINAL LAW. HOWEVER, THERE ARE CERTAIN DEVIATIONS FROM THIS "MODEL", DEPENDING ON THE DIRECTION OF SYSTEM CHANGES. THIS PROCESS IS DIFFERENT, FOR EXAMPLE, IN A TOTALITARIAN SYSTEM, AND DIFFERENT IN A DEMOCRATIC ONE. THEREFORE THE ROLE OF CRIMINAL LAW IN THIS PROCESS IS DIFFERENT, AND THE INTENSITY AND SCOPE OF CHANGES THAT ARE MADE BY THE PROVISIONS OF THIS LAW ARE ALSO VARIED. THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION ABOUT THE ROLE OF CRIMINAL LAW IN INDIVIDUAL POLITICAL SYSTEMS WAS THE MAIN RESEARCH PROBLEM RAISED BY THE AUTHOR.
471	PURPOSE - THE RULE OF LAW AND AN EFFICIENT LEGAL SYSTEM ARE THE CORE FACTORS THAT ENSURE GROWTH IN BRIC ECONOMIES. WEAK INSTITUTIONS AND FAILURES WITH RESPECT TO THE RULE OF LAW IN RUSSIA CALL INTO QUESTION ITS POSITION AS ONE OF THE BRIC COUNTRIES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO PROPOSE THAT THE LEGITIMIZATION OF NEWLY CREATED FORMAL LEGAL INSTITUTIONS IN RUSSIA IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT A NEW SET OF VALUES THAT REFLECT THE IDEALS OF PROFESSIONALISM. IT AIMS TO EXPLORE THE ROLE INSTITUTIONAL STAKEHOLDERS PLAY IN ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NEW SET OF PROFESSIONAL VALUES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - A SURVEY OF EXISTING LEGISLATION AND ACADEMIC RESEARCH ON PROFESSIONALISM AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION IN RUSSIA WAS UNDERTAKEN TO DETERMINE THE STATE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF ITS FORMAL AND INFORMAL LEGAL INSTITUTIONS. THE ROLE OF STAKEHOLDERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROFESSIONAL INSTITUTIONS WAS ALSO EXAMINED. FINDINGS - THE PAPER FINDS THAT THE CREATION OF FORMAL INSTITUTIONS SUPPORTING THE RULE OF LAW IN RUSSIA IS LARGELY COMPLETED. YET, IN SOME CASES THE INSTITUTIONS LACK LEGITIMACY AND PUBLIC TRUST. PROFESSIONALISM - A VITAL INFORMAL INSTITUTION THAT PROMOTES TRUST IN LEGAL SYSTEMS AND LEGITIMIZES ITS FORMAL INSTITUTIONS IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT. THE AGENTS OF PROFESSIONAL SOCIALIZATION SUCH AS THE STATE, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, PROFESSIONAL BODIES AND ORGANIZATIONS PLAY DIFFERENT ROLES IN DEVELOPMENT OF PROFESSIONALISM. POTENTIAL AVENUES FOR ENHANCING LEGAL PROFESSIONALISM BY THE AGENTS OF SOCIALIZATION ARE IDENTIFIED. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE CURRENT STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE ON INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IN TRANSITION ECONOMIES AND SUGGESTS A COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VARIOUS FORMAL AND INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE RUSSIAN LEGAL SECTOR. FUTURE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH SHOULD FOCUS ON THE INVESTIGATION OF THE NEWLY FORMING INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE IMPACT OF OLD INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS ON THIS PROCESS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN RUSSIA SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THE LEGAL SYSTEMS IN THE COUNTRY ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT. EVEN THOUGH MAJOR FORMAL LEGAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN CREATED, SOME INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS STILL REPRESENT A SERIOUS CHALLENGE TO SAFE AND EFFICIENT BUSINESS IN THE COUNTRY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE PAPER CONTAINS IDEAS FOR THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF LEGAL PROFESSIONALISM IN RUSSIA.
472	TAIWAN ENCOUNTERED ITS FIRST EXPOSURE TO WESTERN CONSTITUTIONALISM WITH THE ADVENT OF JAPANESE RULE IN THE LATE 19TH CENTURY. THE JAPANESE COLONIAL GOVERNMENT BROUGHT THE SYSTEM OF SEPARATION OF POWERS TO TAIWAN THROUGH ITS MEIJI CONSTITUTION, THOUGH ITS SCOPE WAS LIMITED EARLY ON BECAUSE THE TAIWANESE WERE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS SYSTEM. HOWEVER, DURING THE LATTER PERIOD OF JAPANESE RULE, SOME TAIWANESE ELITES APPLIED THE CONCEPTS IN THE MEIJI CONSTITUTION TO THEIR STRUGGLES FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, AND TO A CERTAIN DEGREE SUCCEEDED. SINCE 1945, THE CHINESE NATIONALIST PARTY (KMT) GOVERNMENT, WHICH LACKED EXPERIENCE WITH CONSTITUTIONALISM, HAD GOVERNED TAIWAN FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS. THE KMT GOVERNMENT CONCENTRATED POWER IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BRANCH, AND SPECIFICALLY IN THE PARTY AND THE DICTATOR HIMSELF. NEVERTHELESS, FOR THE SAKE OF POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY, THE KMT GOVERNMENT NOMINALLY ABIDED BY THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA CONSTITUTION, WHICH WAS DRAFTED IN CHINA BEFORE THE COMMUNIST REVOLUTION, THOUGH SUSPENDED MANY IMPORTANT PROVISIONS. FOLLOWING THE DEMOCRATIZATION AND LIBERALIZATION OF TAIWAN IN THE LATE 1980S AS WELL AS THE CHANGE OF THE GOVERNING PARTY IN 2000, THE SEPARATION OF POWERS AND THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS WERE GREATLY EXPANDED IN TAIWAN. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THESE CHANGES TO LIBERTY AND DEMOCRACY HAVE ONLY BEEN IN EFFECT FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS, THE TAIWANESE PUBLIC DOES NOT ENTIRELY UNDERSTAND OR ACCEPT THE CONCEPT OF CONSTITUTIONALISM BASED ON LIBERTY AND DEMOCRACY. THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT ONLY IF ALL OF THE POPULATION GROUPS IN TAIWAN EMBRACE THESE VALUES OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY CAN THE DIVIDED TAIWANESE SOCIETY BE HEALED.
473	THE EUROPEAN UNION AGENCY FOR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (HEREINAFTER FRA) PRO-MOTES FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS WITH DATA AND RESEARCH, ADVISES AND HELPS THE EU INSTITU-TIONS AND MEMBER STATES, WHEN THEY APPLY UNION LAW, WHILE FAVORING COMMUNICA-TION AND AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS. SINCE ITS CREATION BY COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) NO 168/2007, THE FRA ADDRESSES A WIDE VARIETY OF ISSUES IN ITS REPORTS, CONCLUSIONS AND OPINIONS THAT AFFECT CHILDREN'S RIGHTS, ANTI-SEMITISM, NON-DISCRIMINATION AND EQUALITY, GENDER VIOLENCE, THE SITUATION OF THE GYPSIES, HATE CRIMES, THE RIGHTS OF MIGRANTS OR AR-TIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, AMONG MANY OTHERS. THE NEW REGULATION (EU) NO 2022/555 OF THE COUNCIL INCORPORATES THE MODIFICATIONS PROPOSED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IN 2020 WITH THE PURPOSE OF IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY, RELEVANCE AND GOVERNANCE OF THE FRA. THE NEED TO ACCOMMODATE THE SCOPE OF THE FRA'S COMPETENCES TO UNION LAW AND TO ADAPT ITS PROCEDURES TO THOSE STANDARDIZED FOR THE REST OF THE EU AGENCIES WERE THE REASONS THAT LED TO THE INTRODUCTION OF SPECIFIC TECHNICAL-LEGAL MODIFICATIONS IN THE FOUNDING REGULATION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ANALYZE WHETHER SUCH INNOVATIONS ARE SUITED TO ACHIEVE AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT MECHANISM REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE FRA WITH THE ADEQUATE AGILITY AND SKILL TO RESPOND TO THE CONTEMPORARY CHALLENGES IN THE FIELD OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.
474	ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN CHINA'S HISTORY OF ENGAGING INTERNATIONAL LAW WAS ITS LEGAL DEFEAT IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA ARBITRATION CASE. THE CASE WAS BROUGHT BY THE REPUBLIC OF PHILIPPINES ON ITS DISPUTES WITH CHINA CONCERNING MARITIME ENTITLEMENTS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA. THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL RULED IN FAVOR OF THE PHILIPPINES, FIRST ON THE JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY ISSUES IN OCTOBER 2015, AND FINALLY ON THE MERITS IN JULY 2016. CHINA NOT ONLY REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE TRIBUNAL'S AUTHORITY, BUT ALSO VIGOROUSLY ATTACKED THE FINAL AWARD AS BEING INVALID AND EVEN ILLEGAL. THIS PAPER CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE DIFFERENT VIEWS, PARTICULARLY THE CHINESE PERSPECTIVES, ON THREE MAJOR LEGAL ASPECTS OF THIS CASE, INCLUDING (1) THE LEGITIMACY OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL, (2) WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL HAD JURISDICTION OVER THE CASE, AND (3) WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL ERRED IN APPLYING UNCLOS ON CERTAIN IMPORTANT LEGAL ISSUES CONCERNING THE MERITS OF THE CASE, IN LIGHT OF THE TWO AWARDS (THE SCS JURISDICTION AWARD AND THE MERIT AWARD) AND THE RELEVANT RULES AND DOCTRINES IN INTERNATIONAL LAW. THE PAPER THEN ARGUES THAT, WHILE THE TRIBUNAL'S OWN LEGITIMACY SEEMS TO BE UNQUESTIONABLE, WHETHER IT HAD JURISDICTION OVER THE DISPUTE IS DEBATABLE. MOST LIKELY IT HAS, BUT CHINA'S CERTAIN ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE JURISDICTION ARE WORTHY OF DISCUSSION. HOWEVER, THE FINAL AWARD'S INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF UNCLOS ARE PROBLEMATIC AND POSSIBLY ERRONEOUS. THE ANALYSIS, HOWEVER, SUGGESTS THAT CHINA WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION ON THE LEGAL FRONT HAD IT FORMALLY PARTICIPATED IN THE CASE FROM THE JURISDICTIONAL STAGE. FINALLY, THE PAPER DISCUSSES THE IMPLICATION OF THE ARBITRATION ON CHINA'S ATTITUDE TOWARD INTERNATIONAL LAW.
475	ONE OF NUMEROUS DEFINITIONS OF GLOBALIZATION DESCRIBES IT AS A DYNAMIC PROCESS WHEREBY THE SOCIAL STRUCTURES OF MODERNITY, SUCH AS CAPITALISM, BUREAUCRACY HIGH TECHNOLOGY, AND PHILOSOPHY OF RATIONALISM AND LIBERALISM ARE SPREAD THE WORLD OVER. INDEED, IN THAT SENSE, LIBERALISM HAS IN GENERAL PREVAILED AS THE AUTHORITATIVE POLICY FRAME-WORK IN PRESENT-DAY GLOBALIZATION. MOST GOVERNMENTS HAVE PROMOTED NEOLIBERAL POLICIES TOWARD GLOBALIZATION. AS WELL AS INFLUENTIAL MULTILATERAL AGENCIES HAVE CONTINUALLY LINKED GLOBALIZATION WITH LIBERALIZATION. CHAMPIONS OF NEOLIBERAL GLOBALIZATION HATE ALSO ABOUNDED IN COMMERCIAL CIRCLES, PARTICULARLY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND AMONG MANAGERS OF TRANSBORDER FIRMS. BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS AND BUSINESS-ORIENTED MASS MEDIA HAVE LIKEWISE FIGURED AS BASTIONS OF NEOLIBERALISM WHICH HAS OVERALL RANKED AS POLICY ORTHODOXY IN RESPECT OF GLOBALIZATION. GENERALLY SPEAKING, NEOLIBERAL IDEAS RECENTLY GAINED WIDESPREAD UNQUESTIONED ACCEPTANCE AS "COMMON SENSE ". ON THE OTHER HAND, NEOLIBERALISM AS A SORT OF PHILOSOPHICAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC THEORY KNOWN AS LIBERTARIANISM, WHICH HAS GENERALLY PREVAILED AS THEORETICAL APPROACH IN CONTEMPORARY, GLOBALIZATION, DOES NOT HAVE MUCH IN COMMON WITH THE IDEAL OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY OF WELL-ORDERED SOCIETY, WHICH ARISES FROM QUITE DIFFERENT IDEAS, ASPECTS AND DIMENSIONS OF LIBERAL PHILOSOPHY. SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY OF LIBERALISM, DEVELOPED BY KANT, HAYEK, DWORKIN AND RAWLS, HAS PROMOTED THE IDEA OF MODERN LIBERAL DEMOCRACY WHICH IS GENERALLY BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW PROTECTION OF HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS, IDEAS OF EQUALITY AND JUSTICE AS FAIRNESS. IN THAT SENSE "AFFIRMATIVE ACTION " PROGRAMMES IN FAVOUR OF THE LEAST ADVANTAGED GROUPS ARE FULLY CONSONANT WITH A GENERAL LIBERAL PHILOSOPHY THAT PROJECTS INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL GLOBALIZATION SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY A CLEAR CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS AND A NORMATIVE REQUIREMENT OF A GLOBALIZATION OF RESPONSIBILITY IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE GLOBAL FUTURE OF HUMANKIND A DEMOCRATIC CONTROL AS WELL AS THE RULE OF LAW IN OUR GLOBALIZED WORLD IS NECESSARY, TOO. CENTRAL TASKS OF GLOBAL POLICY TO PREVENT GLOBAL CHAOS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF UNCONTROLLED GLOBALIZATION INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A LEGALIZED INTERNATIONAL ORDER WITH A SORT OF GLOBAL DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE. CONCERNING THE IMPROVEMENT OF GLOBAL DEMOCRACY AND GLOBAL RULE OF LAW THE GENUINE QUESTION IS: WHO CAN REALIZE A POLICY OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE IN OUR DIVIDED WORLD?
476	THIS STUDY ASSESSES THE CYBERCRIME ACT 2015 AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR ONLINE PRESS FREEDOM IN THE LIBERAL AUTHORITARIAN STATE OF NIGERIA. SPECIFICALLY, THE STUDY EXAMINES HOW THE CHARACTER OF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IN NIGERIA LEADS TO WRONGFUL APPLICATION OF THE ACT TO UNDERMINE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE PRESS. THE STUDY SHOWS THAT NIGERIA'S ONLINE PRESS FREEDOM INDEX HAS CONSISTENTLY WORSENED SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE CYBERCRIME ACT IN 2015, AND IT RECOMMENDS THE PROMOTION OF A HOLISTIC DEMOCRATIC PROJECT THAT RECOGNISES ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL FREEDOM AS BEING INEXTRICABLY LINKED.
477	THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO CONCEPTUALIZE THE ROLE OF CENTRAL EUROPEAN (CE) CHIEF JUSTICES AND EXPLORE WHETHER THEY HAVE MANAGED TO BECOME AUTONOMOUS ACTORS AFTER THE FALL OF COMMUNISM. WE DO SO BY FOCUSING ON SLOVAKIA, WHICH WAS THE FIRST COUNTRY IN CENTRAL EUROPE THAT EXPERIENCED A SEMI-AUTHORITARIAN REGIME IN THE MID-1990S, ADOPTED A EURO-MODEL OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL DURING THE EU ACCESSION, AND FEATURES A FORMALLY POWERFUL CHIEF JUSTICE. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE TURNOVER IN SLOVAK CHIEF JUSTICES SINCE THE 1990S, WE ARGUE THAT SLOVAK CHIEF JUSTICES HAVE NOT BECOME FULLY AUTONOMOUS ACTORS, DESPITE THE EURO-MODEL OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND EU MEMBERSHIP, AS SLOVAK POLITICIANS STILL CONSIDER THE POSITION OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT AND ARE WILLING AND ABLE TO INTERFERE WITH THEM. MORE SPECIFICALLY, SELECTION OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE HAS BECOME AN ARENA FOR POLITICAL BATTLE BETWEEN EXTERNAL PRESSURES FROM THE POLITICIANS AND OLIGARCHS AND INTERNAL SECTORAL INTERESTS FROM WITHIN THE JUDICIARY. SO FAR, SLOVAK POLITICAL LEADERS ALWAYS MANAGED TO INSTALL THEIR OWN CHIEF JUSTICE INFORMALLY, ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED BY COALITIONS FORMED AMONG REPRESENTATIVES OF THE JUDICIARY. THIS HAS HAD SEVERE REPERCUSSIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN SLOVAKIA, ESPECIALLY DURING THE ERA OF CHIEF JUSTICE STEFAN HARABIN. BEYOND SLOVAKIA, RECENT EXAMPLES OF OUSTING AND DISMISSING CHIEF JUSTICES IN HUNGARY AND POLAND, EVEN IF SOMETIMES BLOCKED, SHOW THAT ALSO IN OTHER CE COUNTRIES SOME POLITICAL LEADERS CONSIDER CHIEF JUSTICES AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THEIR STRATEGY TO CONTAIN THE JUDICIARY AND TO RULE BY LAW. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THIS WIDE-SCALE PROBLEM, WE IDENTIFY SEVEN FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE ROLE OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE IN THE POST-COMMUNIST EUROPE. THIS SET OF FACTORS SHOULD ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO STUDY CHIEF JUSTICES FROM COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE.
478	AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CONCEPT OF LAW HART SUGGESTS A MISTAKEN ASSIMILATION BETWEEN CONDUCT THAT IS 'NON-OPTIONAL" AND CONDUCT THAT IS "OBLIGATORY" (I.E. CONDUCT THAT IS EITHER COERCED OR SUBJECT TO AN OBLIGATION). THIS SUGGESTED ASSIMILATION VITIATES THE ARGUMENT OF THE WHOLE BOOK, LEADING HART TO NEGLECT THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH THE LAW TYPICALLY TRACKS, CORROBORATES OR CONSTITUTES POWER RELATIONS. IT IS TRUE THAT, FAMOUSLY, ATTENTION IS PAID, IN THE CONCEPT OF LAW, TO NORMATIVE, LEGAL POWERS. BRUTE SOCIAL POWER, AND LAW'S RELATION TO IT - THE ROLE OF LAW AS A COG IN THE WORKINGS OF SOCIAL POWERS-,HOWEVER, ARE LARGELY OVERLOOKED. THIS IS, IN A WAY, HART'S BLIND SPOT. I LIST SOME OF THE WAYS, OTHER FROM COERCION OR OBLIGATION, IN WHICH THE LAW MAY HAPPEN TO SERVE, CORROBORATE OR BE AN INSTRUMENT OF SOCIAL POWER. I ALSO SHOW THAT HART'S TREATMENT OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE LAW AND POLITICAL POWER, IN THE CONCEPT OF LAW, IS UNSATISFACTORY. BOTH HIS RECONSTRUCTION OF THE IDEAL GENESIS OF A DEVELOPED LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE ARGUMENT SUPPORTING A "MINIMAL CONTENT OF NATURAL LAW" PRESUPPOSE THE IDEA OF A SOCIAL GROUP IN WHICH NO POWER RELATIONSHIPS SUBSIST.
479	SINCE DENG XIAOPING INTRODUCED A MARKET ECONOMY IN THE MID-1970S, CHINA HAS ACHIEVED GREAT PROGRESS AND ITS CITIZENS HAVE GREATER INCOMES. YET, CURRENT RESEARCH DOCUMENTS AN INCREASE IN ORGANIZED CRIME AND CORRUPTION IN CHINA. THE FOCUS OF THIS RESEARCH IS ON THE USE OF THE "STRIKE HARD" CRIME CAMPAIGNS (YANDA AND DA HEI IN MANDARIN) AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIMINALS AND ECONOMIC CORRUPTION IN CHINA. CRIME CONTROL CAMPAIGNS ARE ONGOING AND ARE WIDELY CRITICIZED FOR ABUSES OF POWER. ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY MENTIONED EXAMPLES OF THE OFFICIAL ABUSE OF AUTHORITY IS THE DA HEI (STRIKE BLACK) CAMPAIGN, INSTIGATED BY FORMER CHONGQING MAYOR AND PROMINENT POLITICIAN BO XILAI. IN 2012, BO XILAI WAS DETAINED IN A POLITICAL SCANDAL THAT CONTINUES TO ENGULF CHINESE POLITICS. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES WHETHER INCREASING CRIME AND CORRUPTION, GROWING PROSPERITY, INTERNAL MIGRATION OF RURAL MIGRANTS, AND MODERNIZATION CAN BE VIEWED AS FACTORS THAT SUPPORT THE USE OF CRIME CONTROL CAMPAIGNS. THE CHINESE VIEW DISORDER AS A THREAT TO STABILITY. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW YANDA OR STRIKE HARD CAMPAIGNS ARE USED AS CHINA CONTENDS WITH THREATS TO ITS SOCIAL ORDER.
480	THIS ARTICLE USES THE TERM 'INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATION' TO REFER TO THE CREATION, BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL, OF NORMS BY WHICH THE COUNCIL INTENDS TO BIND ALL STATES, IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR CONSENT. THE NORMS PRODUCED BY THE COUNCIL MUST IN TURN PURPORT TO MODIFY SOME ELEMENT OF EXISTING LAW, OR TO CREATE NEW LAW, AND THEY MUST BE GENERAL IN NATURE. TWO RESOLUTIONS OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL EMERGE AS 'LEGISLATIVE' UNDER THIS DEFINITION: SCR 1373 OF 2001 AND SCR 1540 OF 2004. RELYING ON THE LEGAL PHILOSOPHY OF LON FULLER, THIS ARTICLE WILL ARGUE THAT THESE RESOLUTIONS DO NOT, IN FACT, PRODUCE LAW. UNDER FULLER'S APPROACH, THE FORMAL SOURCE OF A NORM IS INSUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE THAT NORM'S LEGAL STATUS, AS LAW IS INSTEAD CONSTITUTED BY CHARACTERISTICS INTERNAL TO THE NORMATIVE SYSTEM. THIS ARTICLE SETS OUT THESE CHARACTERISTICS, ANALYSES THEM AND SUGGESTS HOW THEY MIGHT APPLY TO THE INTERNATIONAL SETTING. IT ARGUES THAT A PRACTICE OF LEGALITY, IN FULLER'S TERMS, ARISES FROM THREE BASIC ELEMENTS: RECIPROCITY BETWEEN THE LAW-GIVER AND THOSE AFFECTED BY THE LAW; CONGRUENCE BETWEEN STATED NORMS AND EXERCISES OF PUBLIC AUTHORITY; AND A RESPECT FOR, AND RELIANCE ON, THE AGENCY OF THOSE AFFECTED BY THE NORMS OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM. THE ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THAT EVEN FORMALLY VALID ACTIVITY HAS FAILED TO ATTAIN THE STATUS OF LAW BECAUSE IT HAS NOT FOLLOWED THESE BASIC ELEMENTS. IT THEN ARGUES THAT THE SECURITY COUNCIL IS GENERALLY PREVENTED BY ITS VERY INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE FROM CREATING NORMS AROUND WHICH A PRACTICE OF LEGALITY COULD EMERGE.
481	HOW SHOULD CITIZENS EVALUATE THE EVER MORE IMPORTANT CASE LAW OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC COURTS AND THEIR SOMETIMES INADEQUATE RESPONSES (E.G. BY INVESTOR-STATE ARBITRATION) TO THE GOVERNANCE GAPS CREATED BY GLOBALIZATION (WHICH) PROVIDE THE PERMISSIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR WRONGFUL ACTS BY COMPANIES OF ALL KINDS WITHOUT ADEQUATE SANCTIONING OR REPARATION(1)SECTION I RECALLS THAT THE CUSTOMARY LAW REQUIREMENT (AS CODIFIED IN THE VIENNA CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF TREATIES) OF SETTLING DISPUTES CONCERNING TREATIES, LIKE OTHER INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES, IN CONFORMITY WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE AND INTERNATIONAL LAW, INCLUDING UNIVERSAL RESPECT FOR, AND OBSERVANCE OF, HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS FOR ALL (PREAMBLE VCLT), REFLECTS THE CONSTITUTIONAL FUNCTIONS OF COURTS TO INTERPRET AND APPLY LAW IN CONFORMITY WITH RULE OF LAW, JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS AS CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRAINTS ON THE RULE OF MEN AND THEIR RULE BY LAW. SECTION II EXPLAINS WHY SOME OF THE GOVERNANCE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) ARE DUE TO POWER-ORIENTED CONCEPTIONS OF PRINCIPAL-AGENT RELATIONSHIPS AS MEMBER-DRIVEN GOVERNANCE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL FUNCTIONS OF WTO BODIES TO PROVIDE COLLECTIVE PUBLIC GOODS WITH DUE RESPECT FOR CITIZENS AS DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPALS. SECTIONS III AND IV RECALL HOW THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE (ECJ), THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECTHR) AND THE EUROPEAN FREE TRADE AREA (EFTA) COURT DEVELOPED DIVERSE CONSTITUTIONAL METHODS OF INTERPRETING TREATIES AMONG EUROPEAN STATES AS CONSTITUTIONAL INSTRUMENTS PROTECTING FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS AND SOCIAL RIGHTS OF EUROPEAN PRODUCERS, INVESTORS, TRADERS AND CONSUMERS. SECTIONS V AND VI ARGUE THAT THE WORLDWIDE CONTEXT OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW (IEL) DIFFERS FROM MULTILEVEL EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONALISM AND REQUIRES WTO AND NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT (NAFTA) DISPUTE SETTLEMENT BODIES AND INVESTOR-STATE ARBITRAL TRIBUNALS TO EXERCISE MORE JUDICIAL DEFERENCE AND RESPECT FOR THE DIVERSITY OF CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES IN WTO MEMBERS AND THEIR REGULATORY DISCRETION. SECTION VII CONCLUDES THAT NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC COURTS SHOULD PROMOTE COMMON CONCEPTIONS OF RULE OF LAW AND CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE, FOLLOWING THE SOLANGE METHOD OF MULTILEVEL COOPERATION AMONG NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL COURTS IN EUROPE, IN ORDER TO PROTECT TRANSNATIONAL RULE OF LAW COMMUNITIES FOR MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION AMONG CITIZENS ACROSS FRONTIERS.
482	ONE OF THE STATED OBJECTIVES OF THE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION PROCESS IN SOUTH AFRICA WAS THE CREATION OF A POLITICAL CULTURE RESPECTFUL OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THUS, PART OF THE "RECONCILIATION" SOUGHT BY THE TRUTH PROCESS WAS NURTURING A SET OF CULTURAL VALUES AMONG THE POPULACE THAT WOULD MAKE THE GROSS HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES THAT CHARACTERIZED THE APARTHEID REGIME DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO REIMPLEMENT IN THE FUTURE. THOSE CREATING THE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION PROCESS ASSUMED (HOPED) THAT KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S APARTHEID PAST WOULD SOMEHOW CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH A CULTURE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER A CULTURE RESPECTFUL OF HUMAN RIGHTS HAS BEEN CREATED IN SOUTH AFRICA. BASED ON A SURVEY OF ROUGHLY 3,700 SOUTH AFRICANS (CONCLUDED EARLY IN 2001), I BEGIN BY CONCEPTUALIZING WHAT IT MEANS FOR CULTURES AND INDIVIDUALS TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS CONCEPTUAL APPROACH THEN PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR OPERATIONALIZING SUPPORT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS-AND IN PARTICULAR SUPPORT FOR UNIVERSALISM IN THE RULE OF LAW-WITHIN THE SURVEY CONTEXT. THUS, THE FIRST OBJECTIVE OF MY ARTICLE IS DESCRIPTIVE: TO WHAT EXTENT HAS A HUMAN RIGHTS CULTURE BEEN CREATED IN SOUTH AFRICA? BUT THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT FAR MORE THAN DESCRIBING THE HUMAN RIGHTS CULTURE OF SOUTH AFRICA. THE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION PROCESS HYPOTHESIZES THAT "TRUTH" CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THIS CULTURE. BUT DOES IT? WITH MEASURES OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH INDIVIDUAL SOUTH AFRICANS ACCEPT THE TRUTH ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S APARTHEID PAST, THIS HYPOTHESIS CAN BE RIGOROUSLY TESTED. IN ADDITION, I EXPLORE A VARIETY OF ADDITIONAL EXPLANATIONS OF SUPPORT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS VALUES, RANGING FROM EXPERIENCES UNDER APARTHEID TO ATTITUDES TOWARD SOUTH AFRICANS OF A DIFFERENT RACE. I CONCLUDE THAT WHETHER A SOUTH AFRICAN PREFERS A UNIVERSALISTIC APPROACH TO THE RULE OF LAW DEPENDS UPON TRUTH ACCEPTANCE, INTERRACIAL ATTITUDES, AND SUPPORT FOR STRONG MAJORITARIANISM. STILL, EVEN WITH CONTROLS, RACIAL DIFFERENCES IN ATTITUDES TOWARD THE RULE OF LAW PERSIST IN CONTEMPORARY SOUTH AFRICA. PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION OF THIS ARTICLE IS ITS EVIDENCE THAT THE TRUTH-PARTICIPATION IN A COUNTRY'S COLLECTIVE MEMORY-CAN AFFECT THE VALUES THAT INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS HOLD.
483	IN ORDER TO BE PERCEIVED AS LEGITIMATE BY THOSE SUBJECT TO IT, A SYSTEM OF LEGAL NORMS SHOULD BE FREE OF CONTRADICTIONS. THE VERY IDEA OF JUSTICE IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH AN ERRATIC INTERPRETATION AND, SUBSEQUENTLY, ARBITRARY APPLICATION OF NORMS. SYSTEMIC CONTRADICTIONS MAKE ACTIONS BY STATE AUTHORITIES UNPREDICTABLE. HOWEVER, AT THE DOMESTIC AS WELL AS AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, CONSIDERATIONS OF POWER AND INTEREST HAVE OFTEN MADE OF THE RESPECTIVE BODY OF NORMS A "HERMENEUTICAL MINEFIELD." THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER IN PARTICULAR CONTAINS CONTRADICTIONS EVEN BETWEEN THE MOST BASIC PRINCIPLES SUCH AS STATE SOVEREIGNTY, SELF-DETERMINATION AND THE RULES OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW. WHILE, AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, THE AUTHORITY OF CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS MAY HELP TO ELIMINATE CONTRADICTIONS AND INCONSISTENCIES, THERE EXISTS, APART FROM LIMITED REGIONAL ARRANGEMENTS, NO SUCH SEPARATION OF POWERS AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. THE LECTURE ANALYZES, INTER ALIA, THE SYSTEMIC, DESTABILIZING IMPACT OF NORMATIVE CONTRADICTIONS IN EXEMPLARY CASES RELATED TO THE INTERPRETATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER AND DRAWS CONCLUSIONS IN TERMS OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF LAW.
484	COLOMBIA'S 2016 PEACE AGREEMENT WITH THE FARC GUERRILLA EXTENDS BEYOND THE END OF THE WAR, AND BEYOND MEASURES FOR THE DISARMAMENT, DEMOBILIZATION AND REINCORPORATION OF FORMER GUERRILLAS. A LARGE PORTION OF THE AGREEMENT IS DEDICATED TO THE EXTENSION OF THE PRESENCE OF THE COLOMBIAN STATE INTO THOSE AREAS OF THE COUNTRY FORMERLY UNDER FARC CONTROL. THE PREMISE BEHIND THIS EXTENSION, SHARED BY COLOMBIAN ELITES AS MUCH AS BY FORMER GUERRILLA LEADERS, IS THAT IF THE STATE REMAINS ABSENT, THEN THE AREAS WILL BE OCCUPIED BY CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS INTERESTED IN CONTROLLING THE FARC COCAINE TRADE, AND, MORE GENERALLY, THE VAST AND SPARSELY POPULATED TERRITORIES WILL FURTHER DESCEND INTO BARBARISM. THIS PREMISE RESONATES WITH A LONG ARC OF PERSISTENT ASPIRATION FOR A NATIONAL IDENTITY THAT IS SHAPED BY THE OPPOSITION BETWEEN CIVILIZATION AND BARBARISM. THE EXPANSION OF CIVILIZATION HAS, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE TRANSFORMATIONS EFFECTED BY COLOMBIA'S 1991 CONSTITUTION, BEEN INCREASINGLY IDENTIFIED WITH THE EXPANSION OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND HENCE WITH LAW'S MYTHICAL POWERS TO ORDER SOCIETY AND CONTROL BARBARISM. VIOLENCE IS THEN EQUATED TO LAWLESSNESS, AND THE REMEDY FOR VIOLENCE EQUATED WITH THE EXPANSION OF THE ESTADO SOCIAL DE DERECHO, THE STATE THAT EMBODIES THE RULE OF LAW IN THE COLOMBIAN CONSTITUTION. THE FOUNDATIONAL NARRATIVE OF CIVILIZATION VERSUS BARBARISM, INHERITED BY THE HOPES PLACED ON THE RULE OF LAW, AND ON THE RECIPES FOR STATE-BUILDING, BY THE 2016 PEACE AGREEMENT, CONTINUES TO OBSCURE THE CONTINUITIES BETWEEN LAW AND VIOLENCE, AND PARTICULARLY THE FACT THAT THE EXECUTION OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS IN FORMERLY " LAWLESS" TERRITORIES CONTINUES TO ENACT THE VIOLENT MOMENT OF THE ADOPTION OF LEGALITY. BOTH THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL EXPLORATIONS OF THE PRESENT PROCESS OF THE EXPANSION OF THE COLOMBIAN STATE REQUIRES CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THE HOPES VESTED ON LAW, A CRITICAL EXAMINATION THAT NEEDS TO ENGAGE WITH THE MANY CONTINUITIES BETWEEN LAW AND VIOLENCE EXPLORED IN CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY, AND DEVELOPED IN JEAN AND JOHN COMAROFF'S ETHNOGRAPHY. THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THIS APPROACH IS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE ESSAYS IN THIS DOSSIER, WHICH SHARE THE IMPULSE TO INTERRUPT THE FOUNDATIONAL NARRATIVE OF CIVILIZATION AND BARBARISM THAT REMAINS IN THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE PRESENT POST-CONFLICT ENDEAVOR.
485	THE GRAND JURY POSSESSES AN UNQUALIFIED POWER TO DECLINE TO INDICT-DESPITE PROBABLE CAUSE THAT ALLEGED CRIMINAL CONDUCT HAS OCCURRED. A GRAND JURY MIGHT EXERCISE THIS POWER, FOR EXAMPLE, TO DISAGREE WITH THE WISDOM OF A CRIMINAL LAW OR ITS APPLICATION TO A PARTICULAR DEFENDANT. A GRAND JURY MIGHT ALSO USE ITS DISCRETIONARY POWER TO "SEND A MESSAGE" OF DISAPPROVAL REGARDING BIASED OR UNWISE PROSECUTORIAL DECISIONS OR INEFFICIENT ALLOCATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY. THIS ABILITY TO EXERCISE DISCRETION ON BASES BEYOND THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED PEJORATIVELY AS "GRAND JURY NULLIFICATION." GRAND JURY NULLIFICATION, LIKE ITS WELL-KNOWN COUSIN, PETIT JURY NULLIFICATION, IS CONTROVERSIAL. THE DOMINANT SUBSTANTIVE CRITIQUES OF GRAND JURY NULLIFICATION ATTACK THE GRAND JURY'S DISCRETION IN THIS REGARD AS BAD CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICY AT BEST AND SUBVERSIVE OF THE RULE OF LAW AT WORST. ANY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE GRAND JURY'S DISCRETIONARY POWER OFTEN IS ACCOMPANIED BY CONCERNS REGARDING THE DAMAGE THAT CRITICS PERCEIVE IT TO LEVY UPON THE CRIMINAL PROCESS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT SUCH CONCERNS LARGELY ARE UNFOUNDED AND DERIVE FROM A FUNDAMENTAL MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE SCOPE OF THE GRAND JURY'S DISCRETION AND ITS FUNCTION IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE. THE ARTICLE DEFENDS GRAND JURY DISCRETION AGAINST THE CRITIQUE THAT IT IS NECESSARILY INCONSISTENT WITH THE RULE OF LAW. IT CONTENDS INSTEAD THAT GRAND JURY DISCRETION ACTUALLY BUTTRESSES THE RULE OF LAW BY FACILITATING THE GRAND JURY'S STRUCTURAL ROLE IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN AS A CHECK ON THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND AS A MODERATOR OF CRIMINAL LAW FEDERALISM. IN ADDITION, THE ARTICLE MAPS THE SPECTRUM OF DISCRETION THAT IS EXERCISED BY VARIOUS ACTORS THROUGHOUT THE CRIMINAL PROCESS AND ARGUES THAT THE GRAND JURY'S DISCRETIONARY POWER REPRESENTS AN APPROPRIATE, IF NOT OPTIMAL, ALLOCATION OF THAT DISCRETION. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT GRAND JURY DISCRETION IS DESIRABLE BECAUSE IT CAN ENHANCE THE ADMINISTRATION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE-NOT ONLY FROM AN INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO FROM CRIME CONTROL AND EFFICIENCY PERSPECTIVES. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THE G-RAND JURY'S ROBUST DISCRETIONARY ROLE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS NOT ONLY IS CONSISTENT WITH BUT ALSO IMPLEMENTS CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN.
486	THE ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES (IDF) ROUTINELY ROTATE GROUND FORCES IN AND OUT OF THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES IN THE WEST BANK. WHILE THESE TROOPS ARE TRAINED FOR SOLDIERING IN HIGH-INTENSITY WARS, IN THE TERRITORIES THEY HAVE LONG HAD TO CARRY OUT A VARIETY OF POLICING ACTIVITIES. THESE ACTIVITIES OFTEN EXIST IN TENSION WITH THEIR SOLDIERLY TRAINING AND ETHOS, BOTH OF WHICH CENTER ON VIOLENT ENCOUNTERS. IDF GROUND FORCES HAVE ADAPTED TO THIS SITUATION BY MAINTAINING A HIERARCHY OF 'LOGICS OF ACTION', IN WHICH HANDLING POTENTIALLY HOSTILE ENCOUNTERS TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER OTHER FORMS OF POLICING. OVER TIME, THIS HIERARCHY HAS BEEN ADAPTED TO THE CHANGED NATURE OF CONTEMPORARY CONFLICT, IN WHICH SOLDIERING IS INCREASINGLY EXPOSED TO MULTIPLE FORMS OF MEDIA, MONITORING, AND JURIDIFICATION. TO MAINTAIN ITS PUBLIC LEGITIMACY AND INSTITUTIONAL AUTONOMY, THE IDF HAS HAD TO ADAPT TO THE CHANGES IMPOSED ON IT BY CREATING MULTIPLE MECHANISMS OF FORCE GENERATION AND CONTROL OF SOLDIERLY ACTION.
487	THIS PAPER CONSIDERS CURRENT CHALLENGES AND POSSIBILITIES FOR RUSSIA FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF 'ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY'. ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY IS A TERM EMPHASISING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND SOCIO-POLITICAL ISSUES, INCLUDING TRADITIONAL NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES. AN ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY APPROACH PROVIDES A VERY FRUITFUL WAY TO CONSIDER CRITICAL CHALLENGES FACING RUSSIA. RUSSIA HAS PROFOUND ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS WHOSE SEVERITY AND PERVASIVENESS COULD UNDERMINE ITS ATTEMPTS TO BUILD POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC STABILITY. THE NATURAL RESOURCE BASE AND HUMAN HEALTH HAVE SUFFERED, AND CONTINUE TO FACE, PROFOUND DETERIORATION. SINCE THE END OF THE SOVIET SYSTEM, THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN DEFINING AND ADDRESSING MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASSOCIATED HEALTH PROBLEMS. MAJOR BARRIERS INCLUDE A LACK OF LEGAL, FINANCIAL AND CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURES; AN UNRELIABLE LEGAL SYSTEM; RAMPANT CRIMINAL ELEMENTS; AND A LACK OF POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY. THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH OBSERVATIONS ABOUT POSSIBLE AVENUES FOR IMPROVEMENT, BY ADDRESSING FUNDAMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE WEAKNESSES, COUPLED WITH ACTIONS TO STAUNCH THE OUTWARD FLOW OF WEALTH, INCREASE BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL AGREEMENTS, AND ATTRACT EXTERNAL CAPITAL.
488	THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF ANY STATE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN CLOSE CONNECTION WITH OTHER NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEMS AND WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW. SUCH A "LEGAL TRIANGLE" SERVES AS A COMMON LEGAL SPACE, IN WHICH DIFFERENT NORMATIVE LEGAL ARRAYS INTERACT, COLLIDE, AND COEXIST. AND IN THIS RELATIONSHIP THERE IS A LOT OF SUSTAINABLE AND REGULAR, CONTROVERSIAL AND RANDOM. IT IS BASED ON COMMON INTEGRATIVE PROCESSES, STRENGTHENING COOPERATION OF STATES IN THE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND OTHER SPHERES. THE CONSTITUTION OF UZBEKISTAN OF 1992 HAS ASSIGNED AN IMPORTANT PLACE IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM TO INTERNATIONAL LAW. IN THE MODERN PERIOD, WHEN INTENSIVE WORK IS UNDERWAY TO IMPROVE UZBEK LEGISLATION, THE USE OF METHODS OF BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LEGAL REGULATION IS REQUIRED. IN STATE LAW, THESE ARE THE CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATIONS OF FOREIGN POLICY, THE COMPETENCE OF THE SUPREME BODIES OF STATE POWER IN THE SPHERE OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, THE REGULATION OF CITIZENSHIP, THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF THE INDIVIDUAL. IN THE CIVIL AND FAMILY LAW, CIVIL PROCEEDINGS ARE BOTH TRADITIONAL ISSUES OF PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW, LEGAL ASSISTANCE IN CIVIL AND FAMILY MATTERS, IMPROVEMENT OF FOREIGN ECONOMIC RELATIONS, RECEIVED PARTICULAR RELEVANCE. IN THE CRIMINAL LAW AND CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS ARE MULTIDIMENSIONAL ASPECTS OF COOPERATION IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIMES, PROVIDING LEGAL ASSISTANCE IN THE CRIMINAL MATTERS.
489	THIS ARTICLE STUDIES CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED EAST OF THE DR CONGO, SHOWING THAT IN CASES INVOLVING SERIOUS INJURY OR VIOLENT DEATH, PEOPLE EXPECT THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE STATE'S JUSTICE SYSTEM DESPITE THEIR DOUBTS ABOUT ITS FUNCTIONING. THE PAPER USES AN ETHNOGRAPHIC APPROACH TO STUDY HOW THE STATE, IN A CONTEXT OF FRAGILITY BECOMES VISIBLE TO PEOPLE IN THE PARTICULAR DOMAIN OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE. THE DATA SHOW THAT CONGOLESE JUSTICE SEEKERS HARDLY EXPECT REAL LEGAL CERTAINTY, BUT INSTEAD LOOK FOR OUTCOMES THAT COME CLOSEST TO THEIR EMIC IDEAS ABOUT WHAT IS JUST AND WHAT IS RIGHT. TO ACCESS STATE JUSTICE, IT IS WIDELY HELD NECESSARY TO HAVE EITHER MONEY OR CONNECTIONS WITH MORE POWERFUL PEOPLE. FOR THOSE WITHOUT SUCH CONNECTIONS, RESORT TO NON-STATE JUSTICE, INCLUDING POPULAR JUSTICE, CAN BE A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE. THE EMPIRICAL DATA ILLUSTRATE HOW A RELATIONAL APPROACH TO THE STATE CAN HELP IN UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCES WITH AND PERCEPTIONS ABOUT THE STATE AND THEIR REASONS FOR RESORTING TO STATE OR NON-STATE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROVISION. IT THEREBY SHEDS LIGHT ON HOW EXPECTATIONS ABOUT ACCESS TO STATE JUSTICE AND A LACK OF REAL LEGAL CERTAINTY SHAPE THE EXISTENCE OF LEGAL PLURALISM.
490	THIS ARTICLE IN THERAPEUTIC JURISPRUDENCE (THE STUDY OF THE ROLE OF THE LAW AS A THERAPEUTIC AGENT) LOOKS AT THE APPROPRIATE SCOPE OF THE TERMS THERAPEUTIC AND JURISPRUDENCE. THE QUESTIONS CONSIDERED ARE: WHAT IS MEANT BY THERAPEUTIC? THERAPEUTIC FOR WHOM? WHAT IS MEANT BY LAW? WHAT SUBSTANTIVE AREAS OF LAW SHOULD BE INVOLVED? SHOULD THE UNIT OF LEGAL ANALYSIS BE MICRO (E,G., A PARTICULAR RULE OF LAW) OR MACRO (E.G,, A BODY OF LAW)?
491	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICIABILITY PRINCIPALLY WHERE IT HAS BEEN INVOKED IN THE CONTEXT OF CLAIMS IN THE UK COURTS RELATED TO FOREIGN AFFAIRS OR PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW. IT IS SUBMITTED THAT THE MODERN JUDICIAL TREND IS TO FIND THAT ISSUES ARE JUSTICIABLE AND FOCUS INSTEAD ON THE DEGREE AND INTENSITY OF THE REVIEW EXERCISED. THE TREND IS DIRECTED AND SUPPORTED BY THE GROWING IMPORTANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW.
492	THE TEXT IS AN ANALYSIS OF CHANGES AND ACTIONS MADE IN POLAND WITHIN THE JUDICIARY. THESE CHANGES CONCERNED THE MOST SENSITIVE AREAS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS AND THE RULE OF LAW. WITHIN TWO YEARS, SEVERAL DOZEN CHANGES WERE INTRODUCED, COVERING MANY ASPECTS OF THE FUNCTIONING OF THE JUDICIARY, WHICH LED TO ITS DESTABILIZATION, THREATENED THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATUS OF JUDGES AND, AS A RESULT, THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF THE INDIVIDUAL.
493	AFTER THE 2009 URUMQI RIOT, HEAVY MEASURES TO MAINTAIN STABILITY HAVE DOMINATED CHINA'S ETHNIC POLICY; THE AUTHORITY HAS ALSO PROVIDED WIDE-RANGE SOCIAL WELFARE FOR ACQUIRING LOYALTY. IN SEPTEMBER 2014, CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING LAID OUT HIS ETHNIC POLICY, INCLUDING INSISTENCE ON THE ETHNIC REGIONAL AUTONOMY, A MULTI-CULTURALIST OUTLOOK, EQUAL ACCESS TO PUBLIC SERVICES, STRONGER LOCAL GOVERNANCE, RULE OF LAW AND NURTURING OF NEW ETHNIC ELITES. MANY FOLLOWUP POLICIES HAVE BEEN PUBLICISED, BUT CHALLENGES REMAIN.
494	THIS STUDY EMPIRICALLY EXAMINES THE RELATION BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL DISTANCE (ID) AND TURKEY'S OUTWARD FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (TODI). THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS USE PANEL DATA FROM 2002 TO 2016 TO SHOW THAT TODI IS ATTRACTED TO COUNTRIES WITH BETTER INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. WE ALSO FIND THAT HOST COUNTRY POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, AND RULE OF LAW ATTRACT TODI. WE ALSO DOCUMENT THAT TODI IS POSITIVELY RELATED TO CULTURAL DISTANCE (CD) AND ID IS NOT MODERATED BY CD.
495	THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE FATE OF CALIFORNIAN ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY IN SOUTH AFRICA DURING THE YEARS AROUND THE JAMESON RAID. IN THEORY, PROGRESS PROMISED MANY THINGS: COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT, SCIENTIFIC AND SOCIAL ENLIGHTENMENT, FREE MARKETS AND RULE OF LAW. BUT IN SOUTH AFRICA, THESE TOOLS OF PROGRESS CAME TOGETHER IN WAYS THAT DIFFERED FROM CALIFORNIAN ENGINEERS' OWN FRONTIER EXPERIENCE. WHILE MINING FLOURISHED AGRICULTURE REMAINED UNDEVELOPED. AND BOTH, FAR FROM PRODUCING THE SOCIETY IMAGINED BY CALIFORNIANS, FURTHERED IMPERIAL GOALS.
496	ENFORCEMENT AND CONCEPTUALISATION OF ARTICLE 2 TEU VALUES - RULE OF LAW - A NON-REGRESSION PRINCIPLE FOR EU VALUES FACES SIGNIFICANT PITFALLS - LIMITS OF THE 'BACKSLIDING' PARADIGM INFORMING DOCTRINAL DEVELOPMENTS UNDER ARTICLE 2 TEU - INADEQUACY OF A PROGRESS/REGRESSION TRAJECTORY AS A LENS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS - COMPLEXITY OF ARTICLE 2 VALUES THREATENS TO RENDER REGRESSION ASSESSMENTS SIMPLISTIC - NON-REGRESSION AND THE EQUALITY OF MEMBER STATES - POTENTIAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN NON-REGRESSION AND MINIMUM STANDARDS AS TESTS FOR ARTICLE 2 COMPLIANCE
497	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE CONCEPTUAL PROBLEM OF POPULAR INSURGENCY IN HAITIAN REVOLUTIONARY HISTORIOGRAPHY. FRAMED BY FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS OF LEGITIMATE VERSUS ILLEGITIMATE INSURGENCY, OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ELITES AND THE PEOPLE, AND OF THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION AND THE RULE OF LAW, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE PROBLEM OF POPULAR INSURGENCY IS ONE WAY TO LINK TOGETHER ANALYSIS OF PAST AND PRESENT HAITIAN HISTORY AND TO FOCUS ON THE ROLE OF THE HAITIAN PEOPLE IN MAKING THAT HISTORY.
498	IN THE SUMMER OF 2012, ROMANIA WAS PLUNGED INTO A CRISIS OF STATE. STATE INSTITUTIONS FOUND THEMSELVES CRIPPLED BY A POWER STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE NEW GOVERNMENT AND THE PRESIDENT. IN AN ATTEMPT TO OUST CONTROVERSIAL PRESIDENT TRAIAN BASESCU, THE GOVERNMENT REPEATEDLY VIOLATED PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW. BEHIND THE DISPUTE LIES A STRUGGLE OVER THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY. HOWEVER, THE JUDICIARY HAS WITHSTOOD THE PRESSURE AND COULD EMERGE FROM THE CRISIS STRONGER THAN EVER.
499	THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THE OUTCOMES OF THE FIRST PROJECT IN SPAIN AIMING TO MEASURE THE QUALITY OF ITS DEMOCRACY. THE RESEARCH, LED BY THE INSTITUTO DE ESTUDIOS SOCIALES AVANZADOS (IESA-CSIC), IS BASED ON A SURVEY ALLOWING CITIZENS TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR DEMOCRACY. THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON EIGHT DIMENSIONS OF DEMOCRATIC QUALITY, FOLLOWING THE NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK PROPOSED BY MORLINO (2009): RULE OF LAW, ELECTORAL ACCOUNTABILITY, INTER-INSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY, PARTICIPATION, COMPETITION, LIBERTY, EQUALITY AND SENSITIVITY (OR RESPONSIVENESS).
500	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE ROLE PLAYED BY PERUVIAN STATE AGENCIES IN CASES OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS THAT OCCURRED BETWEEN 1980 AND 2000 WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE INTERNAL CONFLICT AGAINST GUERRILLA GROUPS SENDERO LUMINOSO (SHINING PATH) AND TUPAC AMARU. IT EXAMINES THE DEGREE OF ACCOUNTABILITY OF BOTH THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF THE STATE AND THE ARMED FORCES, UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE RULE OF LAW, THEY HAVE AN UNAVOIDABLE DUTY TO RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS.
501	DURING THE FINAL YEARS OF THE SOVIET UNION, AND ESPECIALLY DURING PERESTROIKA, THE OSCE AND THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE WERE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR RUSSIA'S POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL INTEGRATION INTO EUROPEAN STRUCTURES. ALTHOUGH RUSSIA DREW CLOSER TO EUROPE'S SYSTEM OF VALUES IN THIS PERIOD, HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS ARE STILL WIDESPREAD IN THE COUNTRY AND THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT YET FIRMLY ESTABLISHED. RUSSIA'S FUTURE LIES IN COOPERATION WITH, BUT NOT MEMBERSHIP OF, THE EU.
502	JUDICIAL AUTONOMY FROM SOCIETAL ACTORS IS ARGUED HEREIN TO BE A CRITICAL ASPECT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND TO HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED BY THE DOMINANCE WITHIN COMPARATIVE JUDICIAL POLITICS OF THE ROLE OF INTERBRANCH JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. THESE DISTINCT CONCEPTS ARE PARSED AND THEN INTERRELATED TO FORM A TYPOLOGY OF FOUR JUDICIAL REGIME TYPES: LIBERAL REGIMES, PARTISAN CONTROL REGIMES, CLANDESTINE CONTROL REGIMES, AND GOVERNMENT CONTROL REGIMES. THESE REGIME TYPES ARE THEN TRACED IN FIVE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES.
503	EVEN PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES MUST BE HANDLED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE ALTERNATIVE IS SOCIAL CHAOS. EVERY NATION ON EARTH HAS BEEN TOUCHED BY THE IMPACT OF COVID-19, A DEADLY PANDEMIC THAT HAS CHANGED-PERHAPS PERMANENTLY-THE MANNER IN WHICH WE ARE GOVERNED AND LIVE OUR DAILY LIVES. THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THE EFFECT OF THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO THE THREAT OF CORONAVIRUS UPON THE ENJOYMENT OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, BOTH DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY.
504	IN THE CONTINUING QUEST TO COMBAT TERRORISM, BOTH HOME-GROWN AND FOREIGN THREATS, THE ROLE OF THE MILITARY ARM OF DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES IS EVALUATED. WHILE THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE DETERMINATION TO DEFEAT TERRORISM WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, IT IS VERY SENSITIVE ONCE THE MILITARY BECOMES INVOLVED. AN INTENSIFIED EFFORT TO BRING TERRORISTS TO JUSTICE BY PROSECUTION AND CONVICTION BEFORE COURTS OF LAW, HOWEVER, SOMETIMES NECESSITATES THESE DRASTIC MEASURES TO BE TAKEN.
505	EVERY DAY THE SOCIOLOGY OF LAW BECOMES MORE IMPORTANT IN THE FACULTIES OF LAW, IMPORTANCE LIES IN THE PROSPECTS OF THE SOCIOLOGY OF LAW ANALYSIS OFFERS THE STUDY OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS RELATION TO SOCIAL PHENOMENA. ARTICLE REFLECTS ON THE FEATURES THAT THE SOCIOLOGY OF LAW AND THE CONTRIBUTION TO LAW. THE METHOD USED FOR THIS ARTICLE WAS BASED FUNDAMENTALLY ON THE ANALYTICAL METHOD, BY READING TEXTBOOK APPROACH TO OUR OBJECT OF STUDY.
506	IN LINE WITH LAW AND FINANCE LITERATURE, THIS WORK INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INVESTOR PROTECTION AND MACROECONOMIC EFFICIENCY. WE APPLY THE STOCHASTIC FRONTIER MODEL PROPOSED BY BATTESE AND COELLI [1995] ON A SAMPLE OF COUNTRIES TO ESTIMATE MACROECONOMIC EFFICIENCY. THREE MEASURES OF INVESTOR PROTECTION FROM LA PORTA ET AL. [1998] ARE USED. WE SHOW THAT PROTECTION OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW HAVE A POSITIVE LINK WITH MACROECONOMIC EFFICIENCY, WHILE EVIDENCE IS MIXED FOR PROTECTION OF CREDITOR RIGHTS.
507	THE AUTHORS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO EXAMINE THE DEVELOPMENT OF SELECTED ELEMENTS OF THE POLISH LAW ON ASSEMBLIES OVER THE 100-YEAR PERIOD. SUCH AN ATTEMPT OFFERS AN INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE THE POLISH STATE HAS EXPERIENCED VARIOUS POLITICAL MODELS DURING THIS PERIOD (FROM LIBERAL DEMOCRACY, THROUGH AUTHORITARIANISM AND THE STATE OF REAL SOCIALISM, TO THE RETURN TO A DEMOCRATIC STATE UNDER RULE OF LAW). THE SUBJECT OF CONSIDERATION ARE THE PROVISIONS OF PUBLIC LAWS WITH THE EXCLUSION OF CRIMINAL PROVISIONS.
508	IN THE UNITED STATES, THE TRIPARTITE SYSTEM ENSURES THE RULE OF LAW BY DIVIDING THE POWER TO MAKE LAWS BETWEEN CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT. THE SYSTEM, HOWEVER, MAKES VIRTUALLY NO PROVISION FOR MOMENTS OF GRAVE EMERGENCY, IN WHICH THE PRESIDENT IS EXPECTED TO ACT BEFORE AUTHORIZATION FROM CONGRESS CAN BE SECURED. AS A RESULT, PRESIDENTIAL DISCRETION EXERCISED FIRST IN EMERGENCY CREEPS INTO NON-EMERGENCY GOVERNANCE, CORRODING THE RULE OF LAW. THIS NOTE EMPLOYS JOHN LOCKE'S CONCEPT OF THE FEDERATIVE POWER TO DEFINE THE EMERGENCY MOMENT AS LIMITED TO THAT PERIOD OF TIME DURING WHICH IT IS LOGISTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR CONGRESS TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE ACTION. FROM THERE, IT PROPOSES AN ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY, THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY BOARD, WITH THE POWER TO DECLARE AN EMERGENCY DURING THIS INTERVAL, THEREBY AUTHORIZING AND LEGALIZING THE EXERCISE OF EXECUTIVE POWER. WITHOUT IGNORING THE SOMEWHAT FANTASTICAL NATURE OF THIS PROPOSAL, THIS NOTE ENGAGES SERIOUSLY IN A DISCUSSION OF ITS CONSTITUTIONALITY. IT EXPLORES THE REMEDIES THAT WOULD REMAIN AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS WHOSE RIGHTS WERE VIOLATED DURING A DECLARED EMERGENCY. FINALLY, IT EXAMINES WHETHER A SITTING PRESIDENT WOULD BE LIKELY TO SEEK AUTHORIZATION FOR HIS EMERGENCY ACTION. IT CONCLUDES THAT, AT THE VERY LEAST, THE EXISTENCE OF THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY BOARD WOULD REMIND AMERICANS THAT THE SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES DOES NOT DISAPPEAR DURING MOMENTS OF EMERGENCY.
509	THE BREAKUP OF THE SOVIET UNION IN THE 1990S OPENED THE GATES OF IMMIGRATION TO ISRAEL AND TO THE WEST. THE WAVE OF IMMIGRATION TO ISRAEL ALSO INCLUDED CRIMINAL ELEMENTS WHO WANTED TO EVADE THE RULE OF LAW IN THEIR COUNTRIES. THE ARRIVAL OF THESE PEOPLE TO ISRAEL AROUSED MY INTEREST IN THE HISTORICAL CAUSES OF CORRUPTION IN RUSSIA, FORMS OF CORRUPT BEHAVIOUR BY STATE EMPLOYEES, AND THE PROCESSES OF DEVELOPMENT AND CREATION OF CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS IN RUSSIA.
510	THE FUTURE FOR THE LEGAL PROFESSION IS UPON US, REQUIRING VISION AND DEXTERITY TO ADAPT TO THE NEXT GENERATION OF ARTIFICIAL TRIAGE, ANALYSIS AND PROBLEM SOLVING. OUR PRIOR INCLINATION TO NATIONAL ISOLATIONISM MUST BE SET ASIDE AND A COMMITMENT TO PRESERVE THE RULE OF LAW, PARTICULARLY EQUALITY BEFORE AND IN THE PRACTICE OF LAW, WILL POSITION US WELL. STEPS TAKEN NOW TO CREATE NEW WORK, NEW WAYS AND NEW PLACES TO WORK WILL SUPPORT THE NEXT GENERATION OF LAWYERS.
511	THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW TO EVALUATE LAW STUDENTS LEARNING PROCESS. UNDERSTOOD IN TERMS OF JUSTICE, EVALUATION IS CAPABLE OF RAISING COMPLEX DILEMMAS TO TEACHERS. IN CONTRIBUTION TO RESOLVE THOSE DILEMMAS, AND FROM A LEGAL-PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACH, IT SUGGESTS THE APPLICATION OF THREE PRINCIPLES TO EVALUATION: RULE OF LAW, EQUALITY AND LEGAL ACTS REVIEW. A FAIR EVALUATION COULD BE FOUND INSIDE THE BASIC CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK PROVIDED BY THESE THREE PRINCIPLES.

513	THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE DEFINITION OF THE NATURE OF THE BRAZILIAN CIVIL SERVICE REGIME. IT CRITICALLY ANALYZES THE STATUTORY REGIME, LARGELY DEFENDED, SUGGESTING A CONTRACTUALIZATION OF THE REALM OF CIVIL SERVICE RELATIONS AND THE COMBINATION OF HETERONYMOUS LEGAL DISCIPLINE WITH AUTONOMOUS ONE AS AN AVENUE FOR THE EXERCISE OF COLLECTIVE PUBLIC SERVANTS' RIGHTS, SINCE A CONTRACTUAL MODEL SUITS MORE ADEQUATELY WITHIN THE FRAME OF A STATE BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY AND WELFARE.
514	FOR THE PROCESS OF EXTENDING DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW BEYOND NATIONAL BORDERS, GERMAN PUBLIC LAWYERS HAVE DEVELOPED THE CONCEPT OF A "CONSTITUTIONALISATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW." LET ME FIRST EXPLAIN THIS CONCEPT (I) AND THEN, IN A SECOND PART, USE SOME ASPECTS OF THE PRESENT EUROPEAN CRISIS AS AN EXAMPLE FOR IDENTIFYING ONE MAJOR OBSTACLE ON THE ROAD THAT EVENTUALLY MAY LEAD US TO A POLITICAL CONSTITUTION FOR A MULTICULTURAL WORLD SOCIETY WITHOUT A WORLD GOVERNMENT (II).
515	ADMINISTRATIVE SOFT LAW IS A REALITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S ACTIVITY WHICH FACILITATES THE ACHIEVEMENT OF EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT RESULTS. HOWEVER, THIS ABUNDANT INFORMAL NORMATIVE PRODUCTION CAN IGNORE PRINCIPLES AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS. THIS DOCUMENT SHOWS THE NEED FOR SOFT LAW INSTRUMENTS TO BE ALIGNED WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL REVIEW SINCE THEIR ISSUING PROCEDURES ARE NOT REGULATED, AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE ACTS CONTAINING THESE INFORMAL RULES ARE DEVOID OF MANDATORY EFFECTS.
516	IF THE SUDDEN DOWNFALL OF MALI'S OFFICIALLY DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM IN EARLY 2012 SURPRISED MANY OBSERVERS, THE FAILINGS OF THE MALIAN STATEINCLUDING PUBLIC DISAFFECTION WITH THE POLITICAL PROCESS, WEAK RULE OF LAW, AND INADEQUATE DELIVERY OF BASIC SERVICESWERE WIDELY KNOWN BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD. FOCUSING ON ACTIVISTS BASED IN BAMAKO, THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES MALIAN CIVIL SOCIETY'S RESPONSE TO THESE CHALLENGES SINCE THE MARCH 2012 MILITARY COUP AND CONSIDERS PROSPECTS FOR WIDER POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT BY THE MALIAN PUBLIC.
517	THIS PAPER SUMMARIZES 'PROCEDURAL JUSTICE' APPROACHES TO POLICING, CONTRASTING THESE TO THE MORE POLITICALLY DOMINANT DISCOURSE ABOUT POLICING AS CRIME CONTROL. IT ARGUES THAT PUBLIC TRUST IN POLICING IS NEEDED PARTLY BECAUSE THIS MAY RESULT IN PUBLIC COOPERATION WITH JUSTICE, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY BECAUSE PUBLIC TRUST IN JUSTICE BUILDS INSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY AND THUS PUBLIC COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW AND COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW. SOME RECENT SURVEY FINDINGS ARE PRESENTED IN SUPPORT OF THIS PERSPECTIVE.
518	SUPPOSE THAT AN AUTHORITARIAN REGIME WANTS TO MAKE CHANGES TO LEGAL NORMS OR INSTITUTIONS TO CONSOLIDATE ITS HOLD ON POLITICAL POWER. SUPPOSE FURTHER THAT THE REGIME IN QUESTION CANNOT SIMPLY IGNORE THE DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL COSTS OF DOING SO, AND THAT IT HAS AN INTEREST IN RESPONDING TO CRITIQUES OF THESE CHANGES BASED ON LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC NORMS AND THE RULE OF LAW. HOW CAN IT DO SO? ONE POSSIBLE APPROACH IS TO SOW CONFUSION AND UNDERMINE THE NORMATIVE STANDARDS THEMSELVES - IN EFFECT, TO 'GASLIGHT' THE DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE (OR BOTH). TO THAT END, A REGIME MIGHT ASSERT THAT THE CHANGE IT PROPOSES RESEMBLES A 'BEST PRACTICE' FROM ONE OR MORE OTHER JURISDICTIONS. SUCH EMULATION NEED NOT BE THOROUGH, OR EVEN SINCERE; IT MAY SUFFICE SIMPLY TO ASSERT THAT A PROPOSED CHANGE RESEMBLES THAT IN A JURISDICTION WITH IRONCLAD RULE-OF-LAW CREDENTIALS. THE CHANGES BEING ADOPTED MAY BEAR NO REAL RESEMBLANCE TO THE 'COMPARATORS' ON CLOSER EXAMINATION. ALTERNATIVELY, THE MEASURES BEING ADOPTED MAY BE SIMILAR ON THEIR FACE, BUT OPERATE IN SUCH A DIFFERENT CONTEXT THAT THEY END UP SERVING A VERY DIFFERENT FUNCTION TO THE FUNCTION THEY PERFORM IN THE COMPARATOR JURISDICTION. SUCH GASLIGHTING NEED NOT SUCCEED IN DECEIVING OUTSIDERS OR SUBJECTS; UNDERMINING THE STANDARDS BY WHICH LEGAL REFORMS ARE MEASURED, SOWING CONFUSION, OR PROVIDING A SUPERFICIAL PRETEXT FOR INACTION MAY BE SUFFICIENT.
519	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES CHINA'S CENTRAL-LOCAL DYNAMICS IN THE PROCESS OF ADJUSTING REGULATORY DISCREPANCIES AMONG DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT FROM BOTH LEGAL AND POLITICAL PERSPECTIVES. IT FINDS THAT IN CHINA'S CENTRAL-LOCAL INTERACTIONS, LEGAL PRACTICES HAVE BEEN RATHER LIMITED AND ONLY DEVELOPED LATELY, AND POLITICAL PRACTICES HAVE LONG BEEN IN PLACE TO FILL THE BLANK LEFT BY LEGAL PRACTICES AND ACCOMMODATE CHINA'S GROWING RULE OF LAW IN THE CONTEMPORARY ERA. REGARDING LEGAL PRACTICES, THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE LEGISLATIVE REVIEW INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE CENTRAL AND LOCAL STATE ORGANS WHICH HAVE BEEN OPAQUE AND EXPERIENCE A LEAP FORWARD FROM 2017 WITH CHINA'S ADVANCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. AS FOR POLITICAL PRACTICES, THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON TWO TYPES OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE CENTRAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, TOP-DOWN CAMPAIGNS AND BOTTOM-UP BARGAINING. CAMPAIGNS AND BARGAINING HAVE A LONG HISTORY IN CHINA'S CENTRAL-LOCAL DYNAMICS AND INTERTWINE WITH CHINA'S CONTEMPORARY LEGAL DEVELOPMENT IN POLICY-MAKING AND IMPLEMENTATION PROCESSES. DRAWING ON DATA COLLECTED FROM CHINA'S PRACTICAL GOVERNANCE, THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A ROADMAP IN THE EXPLANATION OF THE PATTERNS OF CENTRAL-LOCAL DYNAMICS FROM A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY ANGLE AND CONTRIBUTES TO A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF CHINA'S CENTRAL-LOCAL DYNAMICS THAT SMOOTH CENTRAL-LOCAL TENSIONS AND DRIVE CHINA FORWARD ALONG THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PATH AS A MONOLITH.
520	PURPOSE - CHINA HAS BECOME A MOST DOMINANT PLAYER IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY WITH IMMENSE POLITICAL REPERCUSSIONS, FOR INSTANCE IN AFRICA. THE EXTREMELY RAPID CHINESE ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH STRONG GLOBALISATION WITH, FOR EXAMPLE, ENTRANCE INTO THE WTO FRAMEWORK. NOW IT FACES THE CHALLENGES OF ACCEPTING THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLOBALISATION COIN, NAMELY INSTITUTIONAL TRANSPARENCY, ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY AND FOREIGN POLICY INTEGRATION INTO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE THIS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - MACRO APPROACH USING COUNTRY INDICATORS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH, INSTITUTIONAL TRANSPARENCY, RULE OF LAW AND ECOLOGY PRESSURE. IT RELATES THESE INDEX SCORES TO THE OVERALL SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE COUNTRY. FINDINGS - CHINA HAS PERFORMED WELL ON ECONOMIC GLOBALISATION BUT LAGS ON POLITICAL MODERNISATION, I.E. INSTITUTIONAL TRANSPARENCY AS WELL AS ON ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY FOR A POST-MODERN SOCIETY. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - CHINA MUST ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES OF THE POST-MODERN SOCIETY WITH ITS CALL FOR TRANSPARENCY, SUSTAINABILITY AND PEACEFUL ACCOMMODATION WITH NEIGHBOURS. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - MODERNISATION HAS TWO SIDES, NOT ONLY ECONOMIC GROWTH. AS CHINA IS SET TO BECOME THE WORLD LEADER ECONOMICALLY, IT WILL EMBARK UPON THE POST-MODERN SOCIETY, WITH ITS DEMANDS FOR PEACE, RULE OF LAW AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE PAPER PUTS ECONOMIC GLOBALISATION AGAINST POLITICAL MODERNISATION AND ECOLOGICAL GLOBALISATION IN A CLEAR MANNER FOR CHINA.
521	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT HAS RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION DUE TO RAPIDLY RISING ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, AND FINDING SOLUTIONS TO THESE ISSUES CAUSED BY VARIOUS INDICATORS ARE THE SUBJECT OF RESEARCH NOWADAYS. TO THIS END, THE INCREASING GLOBALIZATION AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY TO ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES HAVE BECOME HOT SUBJECT AND NEED BETTER ATTENTION. ACCORDINGLY, THIS STUDY ENHANCES THE LITERATURE BY EXAMINING THE ROLE OF POLITICAL STABILITY, THE RULE OF LAW, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, AND GLOBALIZATION ON THE ENVIRONMENT FOR 14 MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTH AFRICAN (MENA) COUNTRIES BETWEEN 1996 & 2018, APPLYING CROSS-SECTIONAL AUGMENTED AUTOREGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAGS (CS-ARDL) APPROACH. THE SHORT AND LONG-RUN ESTIMATES OBTAINED FROM CS-ARDL CONFIRM THAT GLOBALIZATION, THE RULE OF LAW, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND CORRUPTION CONTROL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS (CO(2)E). CONTRARILY, ENERGY PRODUCTION, FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH HAVE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECTS, SUGGESTING THEY RAISE CO(2)E. THE STUDY ALSO ESTIMATES A ROBUSTNESS ANALYSIS WITH THE DRISCOLL-KRAAY ESTIMATOR, CONFIRMING RESULTS ON SIGNS AND MAGNITUDE IDENTICAL TO THOSE WITH CS-ARDL. THESE RESULTS DRIVE THE MENA COUNTRIES TO ADHERE TO ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS TO REDUCE CO(2)E STRICTLY. ENVIRONMENTAL-FRIENDLY INDUSTRIAL TECHNIQUES SHOULD BE EMPLOYED, MAINLY WHILE PRODUCING. THE GOVERNMENTS OF THESE COUNTRIES SHOULD FACILITATE THE GOVERNANCE PROCESS THROUGH THE GLOBALIZATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCTS TO ENSURE LONG-TERM ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY.
522	THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THERE IS A 'PRIMA FACIE OBLIGATION TO OBEY THE LAW' HAS INTRIGUED HUMAN SOCIETY SINCE THE DAYS OF SOCRATES. HOWEVER, MOST OF THE WRITINGS IN THIS FIELD HAVE DEALT WITH THEORETICAL ASPECTS OF THE ISSUE, SUCH AS THE BOUNDARIES OF LEGAL OBEDIENCE AND FRAMEWORKS DEFINING THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH A CITIZEN IS NOT OBLIGED TO OBEY THE LAW. VERY FEW STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED THE PHENOMENON OF LEGAL DISOBEDIENCE EMPIRICALLY. THE CURRENT STUDY IS BASED ON A SURVEY OF ISRAELI CITIZENS BELONGING TO THREE SECTORS OF THE POPULATION CLEWS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION, ISRAELI ARABS, AND ORTHODOX JEWISH STUDENTS ENROLLED IN RELIGIOUS YESHIVA SEMINARIES). RESPONDENTS' ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE DUTY TO OBEY STATE LAWS WERE EXAMINED BY MEANS OF A QUESTIONNAIRE ESPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR THE STUDY. THE FINDINGS POINT TO GAPS BETWEEN THE THREE GROUPS: COMPARED TO THE ARAB POPULATION AND THE YESHIVA STUDENTS, SUPPORT FOR STATE LAWS AND THE RULE OF LAW WAS STRONGER AMONG JEWS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION AND, CONVERSELY, BELIEF IN THE SUPREMACY OF OTHER LAWS (I.E. RELIGIOUS LAWS) OVER STATE LAWS AND READINESS TO TAKE THE LAW INTO ONE'S OWN HANDS WERE STRONGER AMONG THE ARABS AND THE YESHIVA STUDENTS, COMPARED TO THE GENERAL JEWISH POPULATION.

523	THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON THE ROLE OF KNOWLEDGE RECORDS IN HELPING GOVERNMENTS TO ACHIEVE A WISER AND FAIRER SOCIETY IT PRESENTS A VIEW OF KNOWLEDGE RECORDS AS SOCIETY'S TOOLS FOR ESTABLISHING EVIDENCE, PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS, SUPPORTING THE RULE OF LAW, AND PRESERVING CULTURAL CAPITAL. IT ALSO DISCUSSES THE ISSUES OF QUALITY AND INTEGRITY OF KNOWLEDGE RECORDS, AND SUGGESTS A PLAUSIBLE METHOD TO DIRECT THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPER KNOWLEDGE RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.
524	ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL, IF UNEXPECTED, RESULTS OF THE SUPREME COURT'S 1992 DECISION IN LUCAS V. SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COMMISSION IS THE RISE OF BACKGROUND PRINCIPLES OF PROPERTY AND NUISANCE LAW AS A CATEGORICAL DEFENSE TO TAKINGS CLAIMS. OUR WRITINGS ON THE BACKGROUND PRINCIPLES DEFENSE HAVE PROVOKED PROFESSOR JAMES HUFFMAN, A DEVOTED ADVOCATE FOR AN EXPANDED USE OF REGULATORY TAKINGS TO PROTECT LANDOWNER DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS, TO MISTAKENLY CHARGE US WITH ARGUING FOR THE USE OF COMMON LAW PRINCIPLES TO CIRCUMVENT THE RULE OF LAW, SUPREME COURT INTENT, AND THE TAKINGS CLAUSE. ACTUALLY, OURS WAS NOT A NORMATIVE BRIEF AT ALL, BUT INSTEAD A POSITIVISTIC EXPLANATION OF TAKINGS CASES IN THE LOWER COURTS SINCE LUCAS, WHICH INCLUDE JUDICIAL RECOGNITION OF STATUTORY BACKGROUND PRINCIPLES. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE RESPOND TO HUFFMAN, EXAMINING THE CONTINUING IMPORTANCE OF THE BACKGROUND PRINCIPLES DEFENSE AND EXPLAINING THE TROUBLE WITH HIS VISION OF LIBERTARIAN PROPERTY AND HIS PECULIAR NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. WE FOCUS ESPECIALLY ON WETLANDS REGULATION, WHICH HUFFMAN THINKS IS A RECENT DEVELOPMENT WHEN IN FACT ITS ORIGINS DATE TO MEDIEVAL ENGLAND, AND THEREFORE IS PARTICULARLY SUITED TO THE BACKGROUND PRINCIPLES DEFENSE. WE CONCLUDE THAT BACKGROUND PRINCIPLES, AS "THE LOGICALLY ANTECEDENT INQUIRY" INTO THE NATURE OF A CLAIMANT'S PROPERTY INTEREST, ARE NOW A PERMANENT FEATURE OF THE TAKINGS LANDSCAPE.
525	THIS STUDY ATTEMPTS TO EXAMINE EMPIRICALLY HOW SOCIAL INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS RELATE TO INTERNET DIFFUSION IN 39 COUNTRIES. BASED ON NINE-YEAR CROSS-COUNTRY DATA, THE ANALYTICAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE RULE OF LAW, EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS, AND INDUSTRIALIZATION SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED THE GLOBAL INTERNET DIFFUSION, WHILE THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM DID NOT EXERT SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. UNCERTAINTY AVOIDANCE AS A NATIONAL CULTURAL PHENOMENON SIGNIFICANTLY INHIBITED THE INTERNET DIFFUSION. THIS SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE EFFECT IS PARTICULARLY TRUE WITH LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCS).
526	THE CONTEMPORARY CONSTRUCTION OF CHINESE INTERNATIONAL LAW DISCOURSE, ON THE ONE HAND, OUGHT TO PRECISELY, SYSTEMATICALLY AND COMPLETELY EXPRESS AND COMMUNICATE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES, MAIN REGIMES AND SUBSTANTIAL FEATURES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AS WELL AS CORE VALUES, BASIC CONCEPTIONS, KEY TERMS, MAINSTREAM THEORIES OR DOCTRINES AND REPRESENTATIVE VIEWS GRADUALLY ESTABLISHED AND DEVELOPED IN THE STUDY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW; ON THE OTHER HAND, IT SHOULD FULLY AND IN A TIMELY WAY MANIFEST CHINA'S CREATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL LAW AND ITS DISCIPLINE AND DISCOURSE. THE FRAMEWORK OF CONTEMPORARY CHINESE INTERNATIONAL LAW DISCOURSE SHOULD TAKE "BUILDING A HARMONIOUS WORLD" AS THE GUIDING RATIONALE; THOROUGHLY COVER THE FOUR BASIC DIMENSIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW AND CHINESE FOREIGN POLICY AND ITS PRACTICE, NAMELY DOMESTIC, MULTILATERAL, REGIONAL AND BILATERAL; COINCIDE WITH, FOLLOW AND RESPECT THOSE RULES, NATURAL LAWS AND TENDENCIES SUCH AS FUNDAMENTAL RULES GOVERNING INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, GLOBALIZATION, MULTILATERALISM, REGIONAL INTEGRATION AND REGIONALISM, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S OBLIGATIONS (OR RIGHTS) AND CHINA'S NEEDS FOR PEACEFUL DEVELOPMENT. IT SHOULD ORIENT ITS BASIC FUNCTIONS TOWARD PROMOTING THE CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT AND WIDE APPLICATION OF CONTEMPORARY INTERNATIONAL LAW AS WELL AS ITS TEACHING, STUDY AND DISSEMINATION, STIMULATING THE PROGRESS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA, PROTECTING CHINESE INTERESTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE CORE NATIONAL INTERESTS, AND STRENGTHENING CHINA'S INTERNATIONAL IMAGE AND STATUS AS A RESPONSIBLE BIG COUNTRY.
527	OFF-GRID ELECTRIC SYSTEMS POWERED BY RENEWABLE SOURCES ARE APPEALING BECAUSE THEY COULD REDUCE ENERGY POVERTY IN A SUSTAINABLE MANNER. YET THEIR DEPLOYMENT HAS BEEN UNEVEN ACROSS THE WORLD. IN THIS ARTICLE, I ARGUE THAT THE DEPLOYMENT OF SUCH TECHNOLOGY PRE-REQUIRES EFFECTIVE INSTITUTIONS. THIS IS BECAUSE THE OFF-GRID POWER INDUSTRY FACES TWO PROBLEMS: GOVERNMENTS (WHO MAY REVERSE POLICIES ON SHORT NOTICE) AND CUSTOMERS (WHO MAY FAIL TO PAY THEIR BILLS). MORE DEMOCRATIC REGIMES, WHICH TEND TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW, CAN MITIGATE THESE RISKS AND FACILITATE LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS. EMPIRICALLY, I SHOW THAT COUNTRIES THAT ARE DEMOCRATIC DEPLOYED CONSIDERABLY MORE OFF-GRID RENEWABLE ENERGY CAPACITY. AN INCREASE IN THE DEMOCRATIC SCORE BY ONE STANDARD DEVIATION LEADS TO AN INCREASE IN DEPLOYED CAPACITY BY 40% (95% CI: [20%, 63%]). FURTHER, I SHOW THAT THIS EFFECT OPERATES THROUGH SUPPLY-SIDE INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS THE PROTECTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. I FIND LITTLE EVIDENCE FOR A COMPETING INTERPRETATION OF MY MAIN RESULTS BASED ON THE DEMAND SIDE: DEMOCRACIES DO NOT PROVIDE MORE OFF-GRID POWER IN COUNTRIES WITH STRONGER DEMAND FOR IT. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT INSTITUTIONS ARE A PREREQUISITE FOR A SUCCESSFUL GROWTH OF THE OFF-GRID RENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRY AND RAISE CONCERNS OVER THE ABILITY OF ITS TECHNOLOGIES TO PENETRATE THE MOST DESTITUTE REGIONS.
528	V.A. MAKLAKOV, A PROMINENT CRIMINAL DEFENCE LAWYER OF TURN-OF-THE-CENTURY RUSSIA, WAS A MEMBER OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (KADETS) AND SAT ON ITS CENTRAL COMMITTEE FROM ITS FOUNDING IN 1905 UNTIL WELL AFTER THE PARTY'S CAUSE WAS LOST IN 1917. HE ALSO HEADED ITS 'SCHOOL' FOR ORATORS WHO PRESENTED THE PARTY'S CASE IN THE DUMA ELECTIONS. DESPITE THIS CLOSE INVOLVEMENT WITH THE PARTY, HE HAD RESERVATIONS ABOUT ITS COMMITMENT TO IMMEDIATE MAJORITARIAN DEMOCRACY AND ITS RELUCTANCE TO BREAK WITH THE LEFT. IN HIS VOLUMINOUS WRITINGS IN EMIGRATION, WHICH ARE ANALYSED IN THIS ARTICLE, MAKLAKOV MAKES A POWERFUL CASE THAT THE PARTY WOULD HAVE ENJOYED A BETTER CHANCE OF ACHIEVING ITS GOALS IF IT HAD SEIZED THE RULE-OF-LAW VALUES INHERENT IN THE OLD REGIME'S CONCESSIONS AS A FOUNDATION FOR BUILDING A CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY. HE ALSO ARGUED THAT KADET CONDUCT IN THE FEBRUARY REVOLUTION MANIFESTED AN INSENSITIVITY TO RULE-OF-LAW VALUES THAT WAS COMPARABLE TO ITS CONDUCT IN 1905-07. HIS FOCUS ON THE PLAYERS' ACTIONS AND REACTIONS LEADING UP TO THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION OFFERS THE INTRIGUING POSSIBILITY THAT A LESS RADICAL KADET STRATEGY MIGHT HAVE RENDERED THE BOLSHEVIK VICTORY LESS LIKELY. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS MAKLAKOV'S CONTENTIONS AND THE RESPONSES TO THEM OF THE KADET PARTY LEADER, PAUL MILIUKOV.
529	USING A PANEL DATA SET OF 189 COUNTRIES BY EMPLOYING DYNAMIC MODELS OLS, FIXED EFFECT, RANDOM EFFECT AND GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM) ESTIMATORS. THE STUDY REVISITS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING COUNTRIES. THIS STUDY IS EVER THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE AND WIDE-RANGING THAT CATEGORIZES THE COUNTRIES INTO DEVELOPING AND EMERGING COUNTRIES USING MULTIPLE DYNAMIC APPROACHES. EXPERIMENTAL FINDINGS OF THE STUDY ARE BASED ON GMM, WHICH INDICATES THAT BETTER INSTITUTIONS ARE IMPORTANT FOR FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, SPECIFICALLY POLITICAL STABILITY, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND REGULATORY QUALITY POSITIVELY AFFECT FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE GLOBAL PANEL OF THE STUDY. RULE OF LAW NEGATIVELY AFFECTS FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH REVEALS THAT IN MOST OF THE GLOBAL COUNTRIES, THE RULE OF LAW IS VERY FEEBLE. CONTROL OF CORRUPTION INDEX IS POSITIVELY EFFECTING FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN EMERGING AND GLOBAL PANEL WHICH INDICATES THAT MOST OF THE COUNTRIES HAVE REDUCED CORRUPTION TO LOW LEVEL. THE CURRENT STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT EMERGING COUNTRIES HAVE REDUCED CORRUPTION, BUT OTHER INSTITUTIONAL INDICATORS ARE FOUND TO BE INSIGNIFICANT. THE OVERALL RESULT CONCLUDES THAT GOOD QUALITY INSTITUTIONS ARE THE MAIN DRIVERS OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND IT STIMULATES FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT. THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT DEVELOPING AND EMERGING COUNTRIES SHOULD FOCUS TO IMPROVE THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY BY RE-EXAMINING THE RULES OF LAW, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND VOICE ACCOUNTABILITY INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS TO MAKE IT BETTER.
530	IN MAPUTO CITY, POST-WAR LIBERALISATION IMPLIED NEW POLICE REFORMS BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW, BUT IT ALSO LED TO RISING CRIME AND AN UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF PUBLIC SECURITY PROVISION THAT FAVOURS THE INNER-CITY OVER THE POORER PERIPHERIES. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW THIS SPATIAL BORDERING OF THE CITY AFFECTED THE CONFIGURATION OF POLICE AUTHORITY IN AN UNDERPRIORITISED INNER-CITY PERIPHERY. BASED ON ETHNOGRAPHY, I SHOW HOW POLICE OFFICERS STRUGGLE TO PERFORM THEIR DUTY AND ASSERT AUTHORITY THROUGH WHAT I REFER TO AS INSTITUTIONAL-JURISDICTIONAL 'BORDERING PRACTICES'. CENTRAL HERE IS THE BORDERS THAT SEPARATE LAW FROM POPULAR JUSTICE AND CIVILIANS FROM THE POLICE AS A STATE AUTHORITY WITH THE DE JURE MONOPOLY ON VIOLENCE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE OFFICERS THEMSELVES CONTINUOUSLY DEBORDER THEIR OWN DISTINCT AUTHORITY BY RESOLVING CRIMES INFORMALLY AND BY RELYING ON CIVILIANS. YET, THIS CO-EXISTS WITH EFFORTS TO RE-BORDER THEIR AUTHORITY THROUGH DISPLAYS OF STATE POWER AND THREATS OF LEGAL PROCESSES. THESE (DE/RE)BORDERING PRACTICES, I ARGUE, REFLECT THE PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY OF THE POLICE. THE OFFICERS CONSTANTLY FACE CONFLICTING DEMANDS: BETWEEN THE NEW RULE OF LAW RESTRICTIONS AND POPULAR PREFERENCES FOR IMMEDIATE JUSTICE, WHICH ARE BOTH INFORMED BY HISTORICAL LEGACIES OF POPULAR JUSTICE AND BY THE SPATIAL BORDERING OF THE CITY THAT PRODUCES THE INNER-CITY PERIPHERY AS UNSAFE AND UNCERTAIN SPACES.
531	CORRUPTION AND CLIENTELISM IN THE GOVERNMENT, SECURITY AND JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS OF DEVELOPING AND WAR-TORN COUNTRIES SERIOUSLY AFFECTS THE POOR AND HINDERS STATE EFFECTIVENESS TO DELIVER SERVICES, THE RULE OF LAW AND SECURITY. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF SYSTEMIC CORRUPTION, PATRONAGE AND NEPOTISM; PETTY BRIBERY (ADMINISTRATIVE CORRUPTION); AND STATE CAPTURE. THIS IS FOLLOWED BY AN ANALYSIS OF INTERNATIONAL ANTI-CORRUPTION STRATEGIES AS A RESPONSE TO CURB THESE MENTIONED DRIVERS OF CORRUPTION. SUBSEQUENTLY, COMPARATIVE METHODS ARE PRESCRIBED TO COMPARE CORRUPTION IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES. INITIALLY, CASES OF STRONG POLITICAL WILL TO FULFIL ANTI-CORRUPTION REFORM IN HONG KONG AND SINGAPORE ARE COVERED. THESE ARE COMPARED WITH SEVERAL CASES OF NARCO-STATES INFILTRATED FROM POWERFUL DRUG CARTELS PERVERTING THE JUDICIARY, THE RULE OF LAW AND SECURITY ARE PRESENTED TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN CHALLENGES OF NAMELY STATE CAPTURE AND SYSTEMIC CORRUPTION. PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFORM, CIVIL SERVICE REFORM AND MERITOCRACY AND PAY REFORM ARE ADDRESSED AS FURTHER STRATEGIES TO CURB CORRUPTION. THE FINAL PART PROVIDES A ROADMAP OF ANTI-CORRUPTION STRATEGY BASED ON THE MAIN CAUSES AND PRACTICES OF CORRUPTION, AND REFORM EFFORTS TO MITIGATE THEM, AS IDENTIFIED IN THE PAPER. THIS IS BASED ON FOUR AREAS: RAISING AWARENESS; PREVENTION; PROSECUTION AND SANCTIONS; AND DETECTION. THE PURPOSE OF SUCH AN APPROACH IS TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS BASED ON THE MAIN FORMS OF CORRUPTION AND CLIENTELISM, AS ANALYSED IN THE PAPER.
532	TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE [HEREINAFTER T.J.] IN THE POST-REVOLUTION PHASE REFERS TO THE POLICIES THAT AIM TO DEAL WITH THE AUTOCRATIC PAST-REGIME VIOLATIONS AGAINST ITS PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND DEMOCRACY AND PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, THE UNITED NATIONS, WITHIN ITS RULE OF LAW INITIATIVE, ISSUED IN 2010, A SET OF FIVE MECHANISMS THAT WORK AS GUIDELINES FOR NATIONS RECOVERING FROM CONFLICTS. I ARGUE THAT WHATEVER THE MECHANISM OR COMBINATION SELECTED BY A SOCIETY TRANSFORMING FROM AN AUTOCRACY INTO DEMOCRACY IS, THE NATURE OF THESE MECHANISMS REQUIRES A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN MULTIPLE CONSIDERATIONS. TO EXPLAIN THIS INEVITABLE TRADE-OFF, I GO THROUGH EACH MECHANISM IN DETAIL, ANALYZE IT FROM BOTH LEGAL AND ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES, AND THEN PROVIDE A BASIC COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS. I SUGGEST THAT TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AS A CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENT REQUIRES A HOLISTIC APPROACH IN ITS ADOPTION AND APPLICATION BECAUSE THIS INITIAL COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS CANNOT BE STANDARDIZED FOR ALL CASES. I ALSO SUGGEST THAT TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE POLICIES THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT PROPORTIONALITY, A COMBINATION OF DIFFERENT MECHANISMS, CUSTOMIZATION OF THE MECHANISMS UPON THE RELEVANT CASE, AND ADOPTING THESE POLICIES IN THE FORMALITY OF BASIC OR ORGANIC LAWS MAY BE EXPECTED TO HAVE THE MOST EFFECTIVE OUTCOMES ACHIEVING THE GOALS OF T.J. WITH THE LEAST LEGAL COMPLICATIONS.
533	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE HOW THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED NOTION OF CHINESE "LAWLESSNESS" DISTORTS THE CHINESE BEHAVIOR BY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IT THROUGH THE WESTERN CONCEPT OF THE "RULE OF LAW" AND TO EXAMINE HOW THE CONCEPT OF "STORIED SPACE" OFFERS A MORE CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHINESE STYLE OF MAINTAINING SOCIAL ORDER. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE PAPER ADOPTS A THEORETICAL APPROACH. FINDINGS - RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN FIELDS RANGING FROM NEUROBIOLOGY TO COMPLEXITY THINKING AND STORYTELLING ARE COMING TOGETHER IN A WAY OF THINKING ABOUT HUMAN SOCIAL SYSTEMS THAT HAS BEEN CALLED "STORIED SPACE." APPLYING THIS WAY OF THINKING SUGGESTS THAT CURRENT EFFORTS, AMONG BOTH CHINESE AND WESTERNERS, TO APPLY THE WESTERN "RULE OF LAW" MAY ACTUALLY DISTORT THE UNDERSTANDING OF A SERIES OF BEHAVIORS OFTEN CALLED "CHINESE LAWLESSNESS". A STORIED SPACE APPROACH SUGGESTS A DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDING AND THE NEED FOR A DIFFERENT WAY OF ADDRESSING THESE CONCERNS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - AT A TIME WHEN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CHINESE AND WESTERNERS IS BECOMING MORE IMPORTANT, THIS APPROACH OFFERS WHAT MAY BE A MORE EFFICACIOUS WAY OF UNDERSTANDING EACH OTHER AND, THEREFORE, ADDRESSING THE VERY REAL DIFFERENCES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER WOULD BE THE FIRST PUBLISHED ATTEMPT TO APPLY THE IDEA OF STORIED SPACE TO THE LEGAL ISSUES THAT ARISE FROM THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH CHINESE AND WESTERN CULTURE MAINTAIN SOCIAL ORDER.
534	THE GROWING PRESENCE OF PRIVATE POLICE IN OUR SOCIETY, AND ESPECIALLY THE FACT THAT THEY PERFORM MANY POLICING FUNCTIONS TRADITIONALLY REGARDED AS THE PRESERVE OF PUBLIC POLICE, RAISES FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS OF POLICE GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT WHILE THE PUBLIC POLICE (AT LEAST IN THEORY) ARE GOVERNED BY AND ACCOUNTABLE TO DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY AND TO THE PUBLIC, PRIVATE POLICE OFFICERS PERFORMING THE SAME POLICING FUNCTIONS AS THEIR PUBLIC POLICE COUNTERPARTS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME FORM OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. GIVEN EXISTING FEDERAL AND PROVINCIAL HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION IN CANADA, AND THE RECENT EXTENSION OF FEDERAL PRIVACY AND ACCESS LEGISLATION TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR, THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE NO INSURMOUNTABLE JURISDICTIONAL OR CONSTITUTIONAL OBSTACLE TO EXTENDING THE NOTION OF A CODE OF CONDUCT INCORPORATING HUMAN RIGHTS TO THE PRIVATE SECURITY SECTOR, INSOFAR AS THEY ARE INVOLVED IN THE EXERCISE OF THE POLICE POWERS OF INVESTIGATION, DETENTION, ARREST, THE GATHERING AND SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION, AND SO ON. SUCH A DEVELOPMENT WOULD CONSTITUTE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARDS ACHIEVING COMPREHENSIVE AND EFFECTIVE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE POLICING IN CANADA.
535	SAMUEL BOWLES' "CIVIC SOCIAL PREFERENCE" IN THE MORAL ECONOMY AND ROBERT BOYER'S "CIVIL SOCIETY" IN THE REGULATION THEORY SHOW IN-DEPTH UNDERSTANDING OF MODERN SOCIETY AND CAPITALISM. IN THIS PAPER, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR THEORIES AND POSSIBLE COMPLEMENTARY RELATIONSHIPS ARE CONSIDERED. FIRST, IT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE FORMATION OF CIVIC SOCIAL PREFERENCES WITH MULTI-LAYERED INSTITUTIONS AND ACTORS BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE MARKET ECONOMY. CITIZENS' SOCIAL PREFERENCES CAN POTENTIALLY DEVELOP IN A WAY THAT COMPLEMENTS THE MARKET ECONOMY, SUPPORTED BY THE RULE OF LAW AND LIBERAL INSTITUTIONS, AS SUGGESTED BY BOWLES, AS WELL AS "CIVIL SOCIETY" IN THE REGULATION THEORY. THIS UNDERSTANDING IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN THE LABOR MARKET WITH INCOMPLETE CONTRACTS. SECOND, IT IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP COMPLEMENTARY ANALYSES OF THE FORMATION OF CITIZENS' PREFERENCES AT THE MICRO- AND MACRO-LEVELS. IN BOWLES' FRAMEWORK, THE RULE OF LAW AND CIVIC INSTITUTIONS PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CIVIC SOCIAL PREFERENCES BY REDUCING MARKET RISKS, AND MARKET RISKS AND INCOME DISTRIBUTION ARE DETERMINED BY MACROECONOMIC DYNAMICS, AS SUGGESTED BY THE REGULATION THEORY. THIRD, IT IS NECESSARY TO ANALYZE DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES BETWEEN LEGISLATORS AND CITIZENS THAT ARE DETERMINED BY THE DYNAMIC FEEDBACK OF THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DOMAINS. IN PROMOTING POLICYMAKERS' PREFERENCES WITH THE APPRECIATION OF CITIZENSHIP AND DEMOCRACY, THE POLITICAL PARTICIPATION OF CITIZENS PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE, AS SUGGESTED IN BOYER'S "CIVIC SOCIAL DEMOCRACY."
536	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO UNCOVER THE ASYMMETRIC LABOR-MARKET CONSEQUENCES OF THE LONG-RUN CIVIL WAR IN AFGHANISTAN BY EMPLOYING A NON-LINEAR AUTOREGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAGS (NARDL) MODEL AND AN ASYMMETRIC CAUSALITY TECHNIQUE OVER THE PERIOD FROM 2004Q3 TO 2020Q4. THE FINDINGS FROM THE NARDL MODEL REVEAL THAT THE POSITIVE ASYMMETRIC SHOCKS FROM THE COST OF WAR, GDP GROWTH, FINAL GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE, FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT, AND THE RULE OF LAW SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, WHILE THEIR NEGATIVE ASYMMETRIC SHOCKS INCREASE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN THE SHORT AND LONG RUNS. INNOVATIVELY, THE COMPOSITE FINANCIAL INCLUSION INDEX HAS BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE MODEL, WHICH PROVIDES INTERESTING RESULTS. IT DEMONSTRATES THAT ENHANCING THE OUTREACH OF FINANCIAL SERVICES PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN REDUCING THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DURING WARTIME IN AFGHANISTAN, WHILE ITS EXCLUSION IS FOUND TO INCREASE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE BOTH IN THE SHORT AND LONG RUNS. MOREOVER, THE RESULTS OF THE ASYMMETRIC CAUSALITY TEST REVEAL THAT AN ASYMMETRIC CAUSALITY RUNS FROM BOTH THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE COMPONENTS OF THE COST OF WAR, THE COMPOSITE FINANCIAL INCLUSION INDEX, GDP GROWTH, FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT, INFLATION RATE, POPULATION GROWTH, AND THE RULE OF LAW TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, WHILE NO EVIDENCE IS FOUND TO SUPPORT A CAUSALITY NEXUS BETWEEN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, FINAL GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE, AND THE SECONDARY SCHOOL ENROLLMENT RATE. THE RESULTS ENTAIL SEVERAL POLICY IMPLICATIONS THAT ARE DISCUSSED.
537	SEVERAL COUNTRIES WHICH HAD BEEN COMMUNIST UNTIL 1989/91 DEVELOPED SO WELL INTO THE DIRECTION OF STATES UNDER THE RULE OF LAW THAT THE EU ADMITTED ELEVEN OF THEM AS FULL MEMBERS BETWEEN 2004 AND 2013. SINCE THEN, THE POLITICAL SYSTEM OF HUNGARY AND POLAND HAS SHOWN MORE AND MORE AUTHORITARIAN CHARACTERISTICS. THE ARTICLE FIRST ASKS FOR POSSIBLE LONG-TERM INFLUENCES ON THE POLITICAL CULTURE OF THESE STATES BY THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION IN EAST CENTRAL AND SOUTH EAST EUROPE AND THEN INVESTIGATES THE REASONS FOR THE DIMINISHING ATTRACTION OF THE EU'S DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND IDEAS IN SOME OF ITS NEW MEMBER STATES. IT TURNS OUT THAT SOME NATIONAL-CONSERVATIVES LIKE ORBAN IN HUNGARY ARE REPROACHING THE EU TO BETRAY BASIC EUROPEAN VALUES LIKE CHRISTIANITY, FAMILY, OR NATION AND ARE PROPAGATING THEIR OWN MODEL AS THE FUTURE OF EUROPE. MOREOVER, THE "RENOVATION" OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS IN HUNGARY AND POLAND IS OUTLINED WHICH AIMS AT DISMANTLING HORIZONTAL CONTROLS IN THE SYSTEM OF POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS, AND TYPICAL PATTERNS OF ARGUMENTATION BY POPULIST PARTIES ARE PRESENTED. AMONG OTHERS IT BECOMES OBVIOUS THAT CONFLICTS STEMMING FROM THE PAST, BUT BEING A TABOO IN COMMUNIST TIMES, STILL HAVE DESTABILIZING CONSEQUENCES. FINALLY IS ASKED, WHICH FORCES INSIDE THE SOCIETIES LIKE THE CHURCHES OR EXTERNAL ACTORS LIKE THE EU CAN CONTRIBUTE TO STABILIZE ATTITUDES AND STRUCTURES CONCERNING THE RULE OF LAW.
538	RECENT STUDIES SHOW THAT, IN ADDITION TO FACTORS RELATED TO THE INTERNAL PERFORMANCE OF COMPANIES, THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT INFLUENCES THE BEHAVIOR OF MARKET VALUE AND, THEREFORE, THE INTANGIBILITY OF COMPANIES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE RESEARCH IS TO IDENTIFY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTANGIBILITY AND THE DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE MEASURED BY CORRUPTION CONTROL AND THE RULE OF LAW OF BRAZILIAN COMPANIES LISTED IN B3. FOR THIS PURPOSE, PANEL DATA REGRESSION MODELS WERE ESTIMATED FOR 183 NON-FINANCIAL COMPANIES, FROM 2011 TO 2019, USING THE ECONOMATICA DATABASE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT BOTH THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND THE RULE OF LAW HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE DEGREE OF INTANGIBILITY OF COMPANIES. THIS RESULT SUGGESTS THAT GREATER CONTROL OF CORRUPTION POSITIVELY INFLUENCES THE DEGREE OF INTANGIBILITY OF COMPANIES. IT IS ALSO CONCLUDED THAT THE REGIONALITY VARIABLE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN THIS STUDY, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO INFER THAT COMPANIES LOCATED IN TRIANGULO MINEIRO AND ALTO PARANAIBA WOULD HAVE MORE ACCESS TO INNOVATION AND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A BETTER RESULT IN RELATION TO THE DEGREE OF INTANGIBILITY. AS LIMITATIONS OF THE WORK, THERE IS THE FACT THAT THE ENDOGENEITY OF THE MODEL WAS NOT CONTROLLED, AND THE SECTOR VARIABLE WAS NOT INCLUDED. FOR FUTURE WORK, IT IS SUGGESTED TO USE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES TO CONTROL ENDOGENEITY AND ALSO TO CARRY OUT SECTORIAL STUDIES TO FIND OUT IF THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SECTORS.
539	JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED AS A KEY COMPONENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT EMPOWERS JUDGES TO MAKE UNBIASED DECISIONS WITHOUT CONCERN FOR POLITICAL REPERCUSSIONS. IN COUNTRIES GOVERNED BY AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL, UNLAWFUL OR CORRUPT REGIME, SUCH AS ZIMBABWE,(2) SWAZILAND,(3) PAKISTAN(4) AND FIJI,(5) THAT INDEPENDENCE, AND IN TURN THE RULE OF LAW, IS THREATENED. MORE PARTICULARLY, ACCEPTANCE OF JUDICIAL OFFICE IN AN UNLAWFUL REGIME COULD BE REGARDED AS MAKING AN IMPLICIT BARGAIN WITH THE GOVERNMENT TO RECOGNISE ITS VALIDITY.(6) THIS ARTICLE BEGINS WITH A DISCUSSION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE,BOTH FROM A NATIONAL AND AN INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE. IT THEN EXAMINES THE STANDARDS OF JUDICIAL INTEGRITY AND SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT IMPACT UPON INDEPENDENCE, INCLUDING APPOINTMENT AND TENURE, AND THE LESS OBVIOUS INFLUENCE OF JURISDICTION. THE ARTICLE THEN MOVES ON TO CONSIDER THE ISSUES ARISING FROM ACCEPTANCE OF JUDICIAL OFFICE IN AN ILLEGAL REGIME IN THE CONTEXT OF FIJI, WHERE LAWYERS AND JUDICIAL OFFICERS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN FORCED TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO ACCEPT APPOINTMENT IN A REGIME WITH AN UNELECTED GOVERNMENT. AFTER OUTLINING THE BACKGROUND TO THE LATEST EVENTS IN FIJI, THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE COMPETING CONSIDERATIONS AND ETHICAL DILEMMAS INVOLVED IN DECIDING WHETHER TO ACCEPT JUDICIAL APPOINTMENT IN AN ILLEGAL REGIME. IT THEN GOES ON TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBLE REPERCUSSIONS OF ACCEPTING SUCH APPOINTMENT FROM BOTH A DISCIPLINARY AND CRIMINAL PERSPECTIVE.
540	THE ARTICLE REVOLVES AROUND THE DOCTRINE OF PRECEDENT WITHIN THE SO-CALLED EUROPEAN LEGAL SPACE, WONDERING WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT WE CAN SPEAK OF A CONVERGENCE TOWARDS A STARE DECISIS MODEL BOOSTED BY THE HARMONIZING ROLE OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT ALTHOUGH THERE ARE STILL SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CIVIL LAW AND COMMON LAW LEGAL SYSTEMS THEY REGARD MORE THE STYLE OF REASONING AND THE DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PRESENT DECISION OF A COURT AND PAST JUDICIAL DECISIONS THAN THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE LATTER UPON THE FORMER. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT A SORT OF MECHANISM OF STARE DECISIS HAS IN FACT BEEN CREATED, EVEN THOUGH, ON THE ONE HAND, UNCERTAINTY REMAINS AS TO THE WAY IN WHICH THE BINDING FORCE OF A PRECEDENT CONCRETELY OPERATES IN THE SYSTEM, AND ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS MECHANISM RELATES EXCLUSIVELY TO THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PAST AND FUTURE DECISIONS OF HIGHER COURTS (HORIZONTAL EFFECT). THIS CHANGE, FAR FROM BEING A SHIFT TOWARDS A TRULY JUDGE-MADE LAW SYSTEM OR A CONSEQUENCE OF THE FINAL ABANDONMENT OF THE DICTATES OF THE RULE OF LAW, ENHANCES LEGAL CERTAINTY CONTRIBUTING TO THE FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENT OF STABILITY OF LAW AS A FEATURE OF THE IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW.
541	THIS ARTICLE EMPLOYS A MIXED METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH TO EVALUATE NON-DISPUTING PARTY (NDP) PARTICIPATION BY MEANS OF AMICI CURIAE SUBMISSIONS IN INVESTMENT DISPUTES SETTLED BY THE INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES (ICSID). THE WORK PRESENTS AND ANALYZES STATISTICS ON NDP PARTICIPATION IN ICSID CASES IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER AMICUS SUBMISSIONS ARE A SUITABLE VEHICLE FOR THE INCORPORATION OF THE VIEWS OF NDPS, AND WHETHER THEY CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW AND POLICY. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT AMICUS BRIEFS ARE A WELCOME ADDITION TO THE ICSID ARBITRAL PROCESS IN THEORY, HAVING CONTRIBUTED TO THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN INVESTMENT ARBITRATION THROUGH INCREASED TRANSPARENCY. HOWEVER, THE LEVEL OF NDP PARTICIPATION THAT AMICUS BRIEFS PROVIDE WITHIN ICSID IS MINIMAL, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY MAY AFFECT THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THE CASE IS VERY MUCH AT THE DISCRETION OF THE INDIVIDUAL TRIBUNAL. IN LIGHT OF THIS, AND RECOGNIZING PREVIOUS RESEARCH THAT HAS NOTED THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF AMICI CURIAE SUBMISSIONS IN DISPUTE SETTLEMENT PROCESSES (INVESTMENT AND OTHERWISE), THIS ARTICLE WILL GO ON TO SUGGEST REFORMS TO ENHANCE THE PARTICIPATION OF NDPS IN ICSID ARBITRATION. THIS WILL, IN TURN: CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW AND POLICY; INCREASE ITS INTEGRATION WITH OTHER BRANCHES OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW (NAMELY HUMAN RIGHTS); AND ENHANCE TRANSPARENCY AND RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW.
542	FORTY YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THE UNCLOS WAS ADOPTED AND IT IS NECESSARY TO REEXAMINE ITS SUCCESSES AND FAILURES. THIS ARTICLE WILL SET OUT TO CHECK THE FOUR LEGISLATIVE FEATURES OF THE UNCLOS AND THEN MAKE SOME SUGGESTIONS. FROM THE ASPECT OF LEGISLATIVE TECHNIQUE, THE UNCLOS IS EXTENSIVE WITH AN AMBITIOUS FRAMEWORK BUT IS VAGUE IN DETAILS. FROM THE ASPECT OF A PRINCIPLED POSITION, MEANWHILE, ITS PROVISIONS ARE MAINLY BENEFICIAL TO COUNTRIES WITH LONG AND UNIMPEDED SEA LINES BUT NOT TO LANDLOCKED COUNTRIES, SHORT COASTLINES, OR AN IMPEDED OUTWARD EXTENSION. FROM THE ASPECT OF RIGHTS AND INTEREST DIVISION, THE DIVISION OF MARITIME RIGHTS AND INTERESTS OF COUNTRIES IN THE UNCLOS IS NOT OPERATIONAL IN PRACTICE. FROM THE ASPECT OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION, IT HAS CONSTRUCTED AN AMBITIOUS MECHANISM ACCOMMODATING VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IS, HOWEVER, TOO COMPLICATED, LACKS FOCUS, AND HAS LOOPHOLES. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD CONSIDER REVISING AND IMPROVING THE CONVENTION IN VIEW OF CERTAIN SHORTCOMINGS AND DEFICIENCIES IN ITS LEGISLATIVE FEATURES.
543	BY COMPARING GOVERNMENT INFLUENCE IN THE REORGANISATION OF LISTED COMPANIES BETWEEN 2007-2013 AND 2013-2019, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ROLE OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IN THE BANKRUPTCY FIELD. IT CHOOSES 2013 WHEN THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY THIRD PLENARY SESSION PROCLAIMED MASSIVE REDUCTION OF GOVERNMENTAL INTERVENTION IN THE MARKET AS THE DIVIDING POINT. THE ARTICLE ANALYSES A SET OF HAND-COLLECTED EMPIRICAL DATA TO REVEAL THE ROLE THE GOVERNMENT PLAYS. IT ALSO EXPLORES THE TENSIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE COURTS IN THE CONTEXT OF INCOMPLETE BANKRUPTCY LAW. BY REVEALING THE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THE REDUCTION OF GOVERNMENT INFLUENCES IN THE REORGANISATION OF LISTED COMPANIES IN CHINA SINCE 2013, IT SUGGESTS THAT THE COURTS SHOULD PLAY A MORE SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN BANKRUPTCY LAW ENFORCEMENT TO FURTHER REDUCE GOVERNMENT IMPACT.
544	DO INSTITUTIONS DESIGNED TO LIMIT ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT PROMOTE THE SURVIVAL OF DEMOCRATIC REGIMES? ALTHOUGH THE INTERNATIONAL EFFORT TO BUILD THE RULE OF LAW IS PREDICATED ON A BELIEF THAT THEY DO, MAINSTREAM RESEARCH ON DEMOCRATIC SURVIVAL TYPICALLY TREATS INSTITUTIONS AS EPIPHENOMENAL. WE ARGUE THAT INSTITUTIONS ENCOURAGE REGIME SURVIVAL BY ADDRESSING PROBLEMS OF MONITORING AND SOCIAL COORDINATION THAT COMPLICATE DEMOCRATIC COMPROMISE. WE FIND THAT PROPERTY-RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS GENERALLY, AND JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS SPECIFICALLY, ENCOURAGE SURVIVAL, ESPECIALLY WHEN MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS FAVOR INTER-CLASS COMPROMISE.
545	HAD THE ARAB SPRING BEEN WIDELY INTERPRETED AS A REVOLUTION FOR 'LAISSEZ FAIRE', IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE STIMULATED MORE REFLECTION ON THE CENTRAL PLACE OF THE ENTREPRENEUR IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND THE FUNDAMENTAL ROLE OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM TO LET THIS PROSPERITY-GENERATING ENTREPRENEURSHIP FLOURISH. THE FUTURE OF THE ARAB SPRING DEPENDS ON THE CAPACITY OF THE NEW DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENTS TO IMPLEMENT MEASURES TO PREVENT CRONY CAPITALISM, RESTORE THE RULE OF LAW AND PROMOTE ECONOMIC FREEDOM IN ORDER TO ENSURE GENERAL PROSPERITY
546	THIS ARTICLE FINDS THAT PRIVATE AND CRIMINAL LAW STANDARDS DIFFER GREATLY - BOTH IN TERMS OF EVIDENCE AND IN TERMS OF APPLICABLE SUBSTANTIVE NORMS. ON THE BASIS OF AN ASSESSMENT OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN CRIMINAL AND PRIVATE LAW STANDARDS UNDER DUTCH ARBITRATION LAW, IT SUBMITS THAT IN THE PRIVATE LAW ASSESSMENT OF ALLEGATIONS OF ILLEGALITY, EVIDENTIARY AND SUBSTANTIVE CRIMINAL LAW STANDARDS SHOULD PLAY A MORE PROMINENT PART. TO THIS END, IT CONSIDERS ARGUMENTS OF SYSTEM COHERENCE, LEGAL POLICY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
547	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE PHILOSOPHY OF LAW OF THE EMINENT TWENTIETH-CENTURY RUSSIAN PHILOSOPHER OF LAW, PAVEL I. NOVGORODTSEV. I DEMONSTRATE THAT HIS VIEWPOINTS EXPRESS A DIALECTIC BETWEEN THE NATIONAL AND THE UNIVERSAL IN HIS UNDERSTANDING OF LAW, A DIALECTIC THAT CONSISTS IN A SYNTHESIS OF LAW AND MORALS, JUSTICE AND LAWFULNESS, AND IN IDENTIFYING THE SPIRITUAL BASIS OF LAW. THE ARTICLE ALSO DETERMINES THE PRINCIPLES OF HUMANISTIC LAW IN HIS CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE FREE INDIVIDUAL.
548	THIS ARTICLE APPLIES THE THEORY OF COMPARATIVE INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE THE TRADE-OFFS ASSOCIATED WITH ALTERNATIVE MECHANISMS FOR RESOLVING INVESTMENT DISPUTES. WE ASSESS THE TRADE-OFFS IN LIGHT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF ACCOUNTABILITY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH UNDERPINS THE GOALS OF FAIRNESS, EFFICIENCY, AND PEACE THAT ARE ATTRIBUTED TO INVESTMENT LAW. THE ARTICLE MAKES TWO RECOMMENDATIONS: FIRST, REFORMS SHOULD ADDRESS COMPLEMENTARITY BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS; SECOND, INSTITUTIONAL CHOICES SHOULD RESPOND TO THE DIFFERENT CONTEXTS THAT STATES FACE.
549	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE CAUSES BEHIND THE LIMITED SUCCESS OF NEOLIBERAL ECONOMIC POLICIES IN THE IBERIAN WORLD. IN ADDITION TO LATIN AMERICA, THE AUTHOR INCLUDES PORTUGAL, SPAIN, AND THE PHILIPPINES IN THE ANALYSIS. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT, IN THE ABSENCE OF STRONG LIBERAL STATES ABLE TO ENFORCE THE RULE OF LAW, ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION HAS FAILED, EXPANDING INEQUALITIES RATHER THAN BEQUEATHING PROSPERITY THE ARTICLE GIVES SPECIAL ATTENTION TO VARIATIONS IN THE OUTCOMES OF LIBERALIZATION THAT EXPOSE THE LIMITATIONS OF CULTURAL EXPLANATIONS.
550	NINETEENTH-CENTURY COLOMBIA OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY THE WAYS IN WHICH POLITICAL ACTORS MADE USE OF THE LAW. IN FACT, THE CONSTITUTIONS CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS THE LEGAL TRANSLATION OF MILITARY TRIUMPHS AND SHIFTS IN POWER, AND EVEN AS INSTIGATORS OF CONFRONTATION AND CONDITIONS PROPITIOUS FOR ANARCHY. THE OPPOSITION BETWEEN CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERALS, MANIFEST BOTH ON THE BATTLE FIELD AND IN STATE INSTITUTIONS, WERE EXPRESSED IN A SERIES OF CONSTITUTIONS. THUS, INSTEAD OF ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW, CONSTITUTIONS PROMOTED POLITICAL DISORDER.
551	THE EUROPEAN UNION SEEKS TO SPREAD STABILITY, DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW AND MARKET ECONOMICS TO THE STATES ALONG ITS EXTERNAL BORDERS. TO ENCOURAGE THE NEIGHBOURING STATES TO REFORM, THE EU IS OFFERING A NUMBER OF INCENTIVES VIA THE EUROPEAN NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICY. THESE, HOWEVER, ARE FAR FROM ENOUGH. THE ONLY LEVERAGE FOR REFORM WHICH COULD WORK WOULD BE THE PROSPECT OF EU MEMBERSHIP. THE EU, HOWEVER, HAS OF YET BEEN UNABLE TO MAKE THIS DECISION. THUS UKRAINE, FOR EXAMPLE, IS CHASING A PHANTOM.
552	THE PRESENT WORK INTENDS TO STUDY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CASE LAW OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PRINCIPLES THAT GIVE INTERPRETATION TO THE COMPLEX LEGAL SYSTEM BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW, BASED ON THE FOUNDING TREATIES. THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE IS TO INTENSIFY THE REFLECTIONS ON THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING THE PRINCIPLE OF DIRECT HORIZONTAL EFFECT OF DIRECTIVES, THE DISCUSSIONS OF WHICH OCCURRED IN THE CASES OF JUDGMENTS REVISITING THE MATTER.
553	DIFFERENT PANDEMICS HAVE PLAGUED HUMANITY THROUGHOUT HISTORY, SUCH AS SMALLPOX, CHOLERA, YELLOW FEVER OR INFLUENZA A. HOWEVER, RECENTLY, AND UNEXPECTEDLY AND ABRUPTLY, A NEW PANDEMIC, THAT OF COVID-19, EMERGED. WITH GLOBAL AGING EXPANDING, THE NUMBER OF OLDER PEOPLE AT RISK IS SIGNIFICANT. THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE LEGAL TOOLS THAT THE "INTER-AMERICAN CONVENTION ON THE PROTECTION OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF OLDER PERSONS" MAKES AVAILABLE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF RESPONSES CONSISTENT WITH THE RULE OF LAW, EVEN IN TIMES OF EXCEPTION.
554	THIS ARTICLE CONNECTS TWO STRANDS OF THE LITERATURE ON SOCIAL TRUST BY DIRECTLY ESTIMATING THE EFFECTS OF TRUST ON GROWTH THROUGH A SET OF POTENTIAL TRANSMISSION MECHANISMS. IT DOES SO BY MODELING THE PROCESS USING A 3SLS ESTIMATOR ON A SAMPLE OF 85 COUNTRIES FOR WHICH A FULL DATA SET IS AVAILABLE. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT TRUST AFFECTS SCHOOLING AND THE RULE OF LAW DIRECTLY, THEREBY RAISING ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES. THE ARTICLE CLOSES WITH A SHORT DISCUSSION OF THE RELEVANCE OF THE FINDINGS.
555	PURPOSE - THE PAPER AIMS TO EXTEND DELIBERATION ON LEGAL AND POLITICAL ASPECTS OF DEBATE OVER GLOBALISATION VERSUS COSMOPOLITANISM INTO THE FIELD OF JURISPRUDENCE PHILOSOPHY OF LAW. IT GIVES PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO QUESTIONS OF THE LEGITIMACY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND EMERGING FORMS OF ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE FOR BUSINESS ENTERPRISES, SOFT LAW, RULE OF LAW, ACCOUNTABILITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - IN TERMS OF RESEARCH METHOD, THE PAPER PROCEEDS FROM NORMATIVE, AS OPPOSED TO EMPIRICAL STUDIES. THE PAPER DEVELOPS ARGUMENTS CONNECTED WITH COSMOPOLITAN JURISPRUDENCE, A VALUE-BASED FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. IN LEGAL AND MORAL PHILOSOPHY, NORMATIVE STATEMENTS DERIVE FROM ARGUMENTS CONCERNING WHAT STATES OF AFFAIRS OUGHT TO BE, HOW THEY ARE TO BE VALUED, WHICH THINGS AND ACTIONS ARE GOOD OR BAD. NORMATIVE CLAIMS CONTRAST WITH POSITIVE ( DESCRIPTIVE OR EXPLANATORY) CLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO TYPES OF THEORIES, BELIEFS OR PROPOSITIONS. VALUE IS BOTH INDEPENDENT OF FACT AND, AT THE SAME TIME, OF AN OBJECTIVE NATURE. FINDINGS - A COSMOPOLITAN JURISPRUDENCE FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE TREATS HUMAN COMMUNITIES AS INTERDEPENDENT AND TAKES SERIOUSLY THE HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS AND ETHICAL AND LEGAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISES PRESUPPOSED BY INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. IN CONTRAST TO GLOBALISATION JURISPRUDENCE, THE COSMOPOLITAN PHILOSOPHY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW SEEKS JUSTIFICATORY GROUND, NOT ONLY EXCLUSIVELY FOR TRADITIONAL FORMS OF CENTRALISED GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY BUT ALSO FOR DECENTRALISED, POLYCENTRIC, PRIVATE AND HYBRID PUBLIC-PRIVATE FORMS OF AUTHORITY. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE PAPER DEMONSTRATES THE INSUFFICIENCY OF JUST DESCRIBING, AS POLITICAL SCIENCE AND ECONOMICS DOES, THE EMERGENCE OF NEW ARRANGEMENTS FOR GLOBAL ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE. AS WELL, IT IS INSUFFICIENT FOR MANAGEMENT THEORY TO PROPOSE INSTRUMENTAL STRATEGIES FOR MANAGING VARIOUS STAKEHOLDER INTERESTS AT PLAY IN EMERGING FORMS OF GOVERNANCE. EFFORTS OF EMPIRICAL RESEARCHERS IN DOCUMENTING, CLASSIFYING AND PROVIDING EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF POWER SHIFTS DO NOT PROVIDE MORAL JUSTIFICATIONS OR GROUNDINGS OF LEGITIMACY FROM HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW. THE PAPER SHOWS HOW A COSMOPOLITAN JURISPRUDENCE STANDPOINT IS A FERTILE THEORETICAL SOURCE FOR ADDRESSING SUCH JUSTIFICATORY ISSUES. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - IN THE CONTEXT OF A RAPIDLY GLOBALISING ECONOMY, THE JUSTIFICATION OF RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT ACROSS BORDERS AND CULTURES IS MORE AND MORE BECOMING A PRESSING PRACTICAL CONCERN. INCREASINGLY, PRIVATE ACTORS ARE OPERATING IN AUTHORITATIVE POSITIONS, FULFILLING GOVERNING FUNCTIONS ONCE PERCEIVED TO BE THE EXCLUSIVE DOMAIN OF NATION-STATES. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - THE PAPER SUGGESTS THAT MORE IMPORTANT THAN FOCUSING EXCLUSIVELY ON DESCRIPTIVE, COERCIVE AND INSTRUMENTAL FEATURES OF LAW, AND SEEKING SOME OVERARCHING SANCTIONS SYSTEM THAT WOULD NECESSITATE PLEDGING ALLEGIANCE TO A GLOBAL SUPER-SOVEREIGN, IS CULTIVATING SOCIAL AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF NON-INSTRUMENTAL INTERNAL DISPOSITIONS OF ACTORS TO RESPECT THE NORMATIVE OBLIGATORY NATURE OF NORMS. THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS PROVIDES A VITAL INTELLECTUAL PATHWAY FOR SURMOUNTING LEGITIMACY GAPS IN GLOBAL ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE PAPER BREAKS NEW GROUND BY DEVELOPING A COSMOPOLITAN JURISPRUDENCE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO GLOBALISATION JURISPRUDENCE. THIS NEW ARTICULATION OF COSMOPOLITAN JURISPRUDENCE SERVES TO PROVIDE ANALYSIS OF PHILOSOPHICAL JUSTIFICATIONS FOR EMERGING SOFT LAW SYNDICATES THAT PURPORT TO ESTABLISH OBLIGATIONS FOR BUSINESS ENTERPRISES AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS TOWARDS SOFT LAW REGIMES TOUCHING UPON SUSTAINABILITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS RESPONSIBILITIES.
556	ADMISSIBILITY OF QUESTIONS FOR PRELIMINARY RULING - INDEPENDENCE OF COURTS AND TRIBUNALS IN THE CASE LAW OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AS DORSCH CONSULT CRITERION UNDER ARTICLE 267 TFEU - INDEPENDENCE OF COURTS AND TRIBUNALS IN THE CASE LAW OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AS ELEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW VALUE UNDER ARTICLE 19 TEU - STRUCTURAL INADMISSIBILITY OF QUESTIONS FOR PRELIMINARY RULING AS PERVERSE CONSEQUENCE OF THE ATTEMPTS TO SAFEGUARD INDEPENDENCE OF THE EU JUDICIARY
557	IN 2002 AT THE INAUGURAL SUMMIT OF THE AFRICAN UNION (AU) HELD IN DURBAH, SOUTH AFRICA, THE AFRICAN HEADS OF STATE AND GOVERNMENT COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO ADHERE TO INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON DEMOCRACY, GOOD GOVERNANCE (POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND CORPORATE), PEACE, THE RULE OF LAW, AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. THEY ALSO AGREED TO HOLD EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE THROUGH AFRICAN PEER REVIEW MECHANISM (APRM). THE PRESENT PAPER EXAMINES WHETHER THE APRM CONSTITUTES A VIABLE PEER REVIEW MECHANISM; AND, IF NOT, HOW IT CAN BE STRENGTHENED?
558	THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE CONCEPT OF GLOBAL CIVIL SOCIETY IS NEW AND DISTINCT FROM CLASSICAL DEFINITIONS OF CIVIL SOCIETY. IT REFERS BOTH TO A GLOBAL RULE OF LAW AND TO POLITICAL CONTESTATION IN THE GLOBAL ARENA. WHAT HAPPENED AT SEATTLE WAS AN EXPRESSION OF GLOBAL CIVIL SOCIETY. HOW THIS INFLUENCES THE FUTURE DIRECTION OF GLOBALISATION DEPENDS ON THE POLITICAL ALLIANCES THAT ARE CONSTRUCTED AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH GLOBAL CIVIL SOCIETY CAN REPRESENT THE VOICES OF THE VICTIMS OF GLOBALISATION.
559	MICHAEL WALZER FAULTS THE POLITICAL THEORY OF MICHEL FOUCAULT FOR FAILING TO PROVIDE AN ACCOUNT OF THE LIBERAL STATE AND THE RULE OF LAW OR TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF KNOWLEDGE THAT REGULATES DISCIPLINARY ARRANGEMENTS IN SOCIETY. THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES WALZER'S CRITICISM IN LIGHT OF FOUCAULT'S ANALYSIS OF LIBERAL POLITICAL THEORY. IT CONCLUDES THAT WALZER'S THEORY, COUCHED IN THE DISCOURSE OF SOVEREIGNTY, EMPLOYS DISCIPLINARY STRATEGIES OF POWER, AKIN TO THOSE FOUCAULT DESCRIBES, TO COMBAT THE TYRANNICAL STATE.
560	DESPITE THE ENORMOUS IMPORTANCE OF GOOD LAND GOVERNANCE FOR SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SOCIAL JUSTICE, LAND ADMINISTRATION REMAINS A SECTOR THAT IS LACKING OPENNESS AND TRANSPARENCY IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD. LAND REGISTRY AND CADASTRAL RECORDS ARE OFTEN DEEMED TOO SENSITIVE TO SHARE, UNLESS ACQUIRED FOR A FEE, OR THE RECORDS THEMSELVES MAY BE UNRELIABLE OR IN FORMATS THAT ARE NOT EASILY ACCESSIBLE. IN GEOGRAPHIES WHERE THE RULE OF LAW MAY NOT BE STRONG, THIS PRESENTS OPPORTUNITIES FOR GOVERNMENT ABUSE AND CORRUPTION.
561	THIS PAPER'S PURPOSE IS TO DISCUSS THE CIVIL RIGHT OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AS AN ELEMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, IN A SOCIAL CONTEXT OF POPULAR DEMONSTRATIONS OCCURRED IN BRAZIL SINCE JUNE 2013. WITH THAT IN MIND, THE ANALYSIS INTENDS TO PRESENT ONE POSSIBLE RELATION BETWEEN THE ACTION OF ONE SPECIFIC GROUP TAKING PART AT EPISODES OF STREET OCCUPATION - THE BLACK BLOCS - AND THE IMMEDIATE LEGISLATIVE REACTION PROHIBITING THE USE OF MASKS DURING DEMONSTRATIONS IN PUBLIC AREAS.
562	THROUGHOUT THE POST-SOVIET REGION, CONFLICTS OVER PROPERTY FEATURE PROMINENTLY IN LOCAL HEADLINES AND PUBLIC DEBATES. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES OWNERSHIP CONFLICTS IN CONTEMPORARY KYRGYZSTAN BY ASKING WHY SOME MARKETPLACES (BAZAARS) HAVE REMAINED STABLE AND RELATIVELY SECURE IN AN ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY WEAK RULE OF LAW AND ONGOING ASSET REDISTRIBUTION. USING DATA FROM FIELD RESEARCH CONDUCTED IN 2006-2007, INCLUDING INTERVIEWS, NEWSPAPER ARTICLES, AND GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS, THE ARTICLE IDENTIFIES HISTORICAL AND POLITICAL MECHANISMS THAT ALLOW BAZAAR OWNERS TO SECURE THEIR ASSETS IN THIS ENVIRONMENT.
563	ADVANCES IN EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY, EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS AND NEUROSCIENCE ARE SHEDDING NEW LIGHT ON AGE-OLD QUESTIONS ABOUT RIGHT AND WRONG, JUSTICE, FREEDOM, THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE STATE. EVIDENCE IS BEGINNING TO ACCUMULATE SUGGESTING THAT HUMANS EVOLVED CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL BEHAVIOURAL PREDISPOSITIONS GROUNDED IN OUR INTENSE SOCIAL NATURES, THAT THOSE PREDISPOSITIONS ARE ENCODED IN OUR BRAINS AS A DISTRIBUTION OF PROBABLE BEHAVIOURS, AND THEREFORE THAT THERE MAY BE A CORE OF UNIVERSAL HUMAN LAW.
564	THIS ARTICLE USES PRINCIPLES ABSTRACTED FROM DEVELOPED COUNTRIES TO EXAMINE THE CONTINUITY OF INSIDER TRADING ENFORCEMENT FROM VARIOUS CASES IN CHINA. IT THEN ARGUES THAT CHINESE ENFORCEMENT PRINCIPLES ARE INCONSISTENT AND CONCLUDES THAT THE CURRENT POLICY-ORIENTATED ENFORCEMENT APPROACH DOES NOT IMPROVE MARKET FAIRNESS OR RULE OF LAW. REGULAR LEGISLATIVE REVIEW IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT BECOME TOO EXCESSIVE IN THE CHINESE EQUITY MARKET. ADDITIONALLY, ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION TO CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS AND BUREAUCRATS WITH INSIDE INFORMATION.
565	THIS PAPER ANALYSES HOW INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS AFFECT SATISFACTION WITH DEMOCRACY (SWD). IT EMPLOYS A PANEL OF OBSERVATIONS FROM EUROBAROMETERS IN THE TIME SPAN 1990-2000, AND THUS IS ONE OF THE FIRST STUDIES TO CONSIDER THE LONGITUDINAL DIMENSION OF THE DRIVING FORCES OF SWD. WE FIND THAT HIGH-QUALITY INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE RULE OF LAW, WELL-FUNCTIONING REGULATION, LOW CORRUPTION, AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT IMPROVE RESOURCE ALLOCATION HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON AVERAGE SATISFACTION WITH DEMOCRACY. (C) 2008 PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER B.V.
566	THIS PAPER CONSIDERS THE UK SUPREME COURT DECISION IN AXA V. LORD ADVOCATE. ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT APPEAR A PURELY SCOTTISH CASE, DEALING WITH DAMAGES PRODUCED BY ASBESTOS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF RECOVERING THEM BY VIRTUE OF AN ACT OF THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT, IT IS ARGUED THAT THIS CASE CLARIFIES THE STATUS OF ACTS OF THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT AND THE NATURE OF HIS POWERS. FURTHERMORE, RELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS OF THE UK CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES OF PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE ADDRESSED.
567	THE PAPER PUTS FORWARD THREE INTERRELATED REASONS THAT ACCOUNT FOR THE RECENT BREAKDOWN OF THE FINANCE-GROWTH NEXUS, COMPRISING THE USE (OR ABUSE) OF THE RELATIONSHIP BY POLICYMAKERS, CAPTURE BY RULING ELITES AND INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS. EVIDENCE CONSISTENT WITH THESE HYPOTHESES IS PROVIDED FROM A RECENT EUROPEAN BANKING CRISIS. IT CONCLUDES THAT IN ORDER TO RESTORE THE ABILITY OF FINANCE TO PROMOTE GROWTH, THE INFLUENCE OF RULING ELITES ON THE RULE OF LAW, FINANCIAL REGULATION AND SUPERVISION NEEDS TO BE MINIMIZED.
568	THIS WRITTEN PRETENDS, SINCE A CONTEXTUAL POINT OF VIEW, TO INVESTIGATE FOR IDEAL INSPIRATIONAL REASONS OF THE CIVIL AND MERCANTILE CODIFICATIONS IN THE MARC OF THE DEMOCRATIC LIBERAL BOURGEOIS RULE OF LAW, BECAUSE IT IS CONSIDERED THAT IN THIS HISTORIC MOMENT THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE RECOMPOSED ABOUT THEIR PRINCIPLES AND VALUES, WHICH, TO EFFECTS TO MAKE POSSIBLE THAT THE STATE IS BASED ON ECONOMIC, THEY ADOPT A UTILITARIAN APPEARANCE THAT IN SATISFIES THE INTERESTS OF THE SOCIAL CLASSES IN GROWING TO THE POWER.
569	THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS TEXT IS TO UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT THREATS TO THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW IN BRAZIL AND TO IDENTIFY ITS SUPPORT BASE IN SOCIETY. A SUPPORT BASE THAT IS BEING RECRUITED BY EXTREMISTS AMONG NEW CHARACTERS WHO HAVE ENTERED THE DEMOCRATIC SCENE IN RECENT YEARS THROUGH THE PROMOTION OF INSTITUTIONAL STRESS SITUATIONS. THE TEXT ALSO DEFENDS A STANCE FOR JURISTS IN THE FACE OF SUCH THREATS IN THE TENSION BETWEEN STRUGGLES FOR RIGHTS, RADICAL UTOPIAS, AND INSTITUTIONAL UTOPIAS.
570	REGULATION (EU) 462/2013 IMPOSES CIVIL LIABILITY UPON CREDIT RATING AGENCIES FOR CAUSING LOSS TO INVESTORS BY VIRTUE OF INTENTIONAL OR GROSSLY NEGLIGENT INFRINGEMENT OF CERTAIN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THIS REGULATION DOES NOTHING MORE THAN REPLICATE THE UK'S EXISTING LAW ON DECEIT, ALBEIT THAT IT IS (INEXPLICABLY) MORE RESTRICTIVE FOR CLAIMANTS. FURTHER, IT CONSIDERS THE POTENTIAL HARM TO TAXONOMY AND-BY EXTENSION-TO THE RULE OF LAW CAUSED BY SUCH LEGAL DUPLICATION WHEN RESORTING TO VERY SPECIFIC HARMONISATION MEASURES.
571	THE PAPER ANALYSES HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW, THE NECESSITY OF STRIKING A BALANCE BETWEEN RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, BETWEEN THE INTERESTS OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND THOSE OF THE STATE. THE AUTHOR HIGHLIGHTS THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN CRIMINAL SITUATION IN RUSSIA AND CRIMINAL POLICY PURSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT, THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED IN THE PAPER. IT SUBSTANTIATES THE NECESSITY FOR TOUGHENING MEASURES AIMED AT FIGHTING CRIMINALITY IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THE PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS.
572	EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT A LACK OF EFFECTIVE CHECKS AND BALANCES AGAINST CORRUPTION UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW, THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THE NEED FOR AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY TO ESTABLISH AN AFRICAN COMMISSION AGAINST CORRUPTION, INVOLVING UNITED NATIONS INSPECTORS TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE CORRUPTION. A RANGE OF EVIDENCE IS REVIEWED SUGGESTING THAT PRESSURE FROM CONSTITUENTS AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN COMPELLING AFRICAN LEADERS TO SIGN THIS TYPE OF PROTOCOL.
573	THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE IMPACT OF POLITICAL DISCRETION AND CORRUPTION ON FIRM CREATION RATES, DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN FORMAL AND INFORMAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT POLITICAL DISCRETION DISCOURAGES THE CREATION OF FORMAL ENTERPRISES AS FEWER RESTRICTIONS ON THE GOVERNMENT'S OPPORTUNISTIC BEHAVIOUR INCREASES UNCERTAINTY AND RISKS FOR ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITIES. CORRUPTION ALSO HAS A NEGATIVE INFLUENCE ON FORMAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP, AS IT INCREASES THE COSTS OF THE PROCEDURES REQUIRED TO CREATE AND MANAGE THE COMPANY WITH NO ASSURANCE THAT THE OTHER PARTY WILL FULFIL THE AGREEMENT. REGARDING INFORMAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP, OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CORRUPTION ALSO APPLIES TO NON-FORMALISED FIRMS.
574	INTERNATIONAL ARMS CONTROL OPERATIONS ARE BASED ON A FOUNDATION OF GLOBAL PROGRAMS AND INSTRUMENTS. AN ANALYSIS OF THESE OPERATIONS GIVES AN INDICATION OF THE MANY CHALLENGES THEY FACE IN PRACTICE AND WHAT ADMINISTRATIVE MEANS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO ADDRESS THEM. SPECIAL ATTENTION IS DEVOTED TO THE SECONDARY NORMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEM OF THE FIELD OPERATION, OFTEN CONCEIVED AS A LARGELY AUTONOMOUS SELF-CONTAINED REGIME, AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF ITS HIGHER AUTHORITY AND GENERAL INTERNATIONAL LAW. FINALLY, THE INCREASINGLY RELEVANT PARTICIPATORY ROLE OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN ARMS CONTROL AND ITS CONFORMITY WITH BASIC PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW WILL ALSO BE EXAMINED.
575	THIS SECOND AND CONCLUDING PART OF A TWO-PART ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE ANNULMENT ACTIONS BY ADVOCATE GENERAL SHARPSTON OF THE CJEU SEEKING TO CHALLENGE THE PREMATURE TERMINATION OF HER TERM OF OFFICE AS A RESULT OF A DECISION OF THE MEMBER STATE GOVERNMENTS, FOLLOWING WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNITED KINGDOM FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION. WHILE IN ITS CASE LAW THE COURT OF JUSTICE HAS BEEN IN THE VANGUARD IN ENSURING THE PROTECTION OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN THE COURTS OF THE MEMBER STATES AND THE RIGHT OF JUDGES TO A REVIEW OF DECISIONS ENTAILING THEIR DISMISSAL, MS. SHARPSTON'S PROCEEDINGS WERE REJECTED BY BOTH THE GENERAL COURT AND ON APPEAL THE COURT OF JUSTICE ESSENTIALLY ON GROUNDS OF LACK OF JURISDICTION. THE COURTS' REASONING IS INCOMPLETE AND UNCONVINCING, AND DOUBTS REMAIN AS TO WHETHER THE FORMER ADVOCATE GENERAL HAS BEEN AFFORDED EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION OF HER CLAIMED RIGHT TO FINISH OUT HER TERM OF OFFICE.
576	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES SOME OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL TACTICS THAT WE MOST FREQUENTLY SEE DEPLOYED BY ANTI-GENDER MOVEMENTS AND ILLUSTRATES THEM WITH EXAMPLES DRAWN FROM THE COMPARATIVE PRACTICE OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES. TO DO SO, IT FOCUSES ON SOME OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL AND PRIORITIZED THEMATIC AREAS IN THE CONSTITU-TIONAL BATTLES LED BY SUCH MOVEMENTS, SUCH AS REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, GENDER VIOLENCE, GENDER STUDIES AND SAME-SEX MARRIAGE OR UNIONS.
577	THIS ARTICLE RAISES FIVE KEY PROBLEMS FOR THE LAW IN ITS DEALINGS WITH THOSE WITH SEVERE PERSONALITY DISORDER. THESE PROBLEMS ARE SET IN THE CONTEXT OF A LEGISLATIVE AGENDA THAT HAS EMBRACED THE CONFLICTING OBJECTIVES OF REHABILITATION AND INCAPACITATION, WHILE STRIVING TO IMPROVE TREATMENT FOR THOSE WITH SEVERE PERSONALITY DISORDER, AND MINIMIZING THE RISK THAT THEY ARE THOUGHT TO POSE TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS. THE PROBLEMS ARE EXAMINED FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF LEGISLATORS, REALISTS, CLINICIANS AND COURTS, EMPIRICISTS AND, FINALLY, NORMATIVISTS; IN SHORT, WHAT SHOULD THE LAW BE DOING IN THIS ARENA? THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY URGING A CAUTIONARY ADHERENCE TO ISSUES OF LEGAL PRINCIPLE IN PREFERENCE TO THE, ALBEIT STARKLY PORTRAYED, ALTERNATIVES: NAMELY, THE SEDUCTIVE ATTRACTIONS OF THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION, OR THE DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS OF INDETERMINATE CONTAINMENT.
578	THIS TIME A HISTORICAL APPROACH AIMS AT THE CONCEPT TO IDENTIFY THE OPPORTUNITY THAT ARISES AS A LEGAL CATEGORY IN THE AUTONOMOUS ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ARTICLES AND LEAD TO SUBSEQUENT IDENTIFICATION OF THEIR IMPACT AND EFFECTIVENESS IN THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF PUBLIC SERVANTS OF THE SECURITY FORCES.
579	THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A READING OF MANUEL ZAPATA OLIVELLA'S NOVEL, CHAMBACU, BLACK SLUM, EMPLOYING PHILOSOPHER ACHILLE MBEMBE'S CONCEPT OF NECROPOLITICS TO REFLECT ON CARTAGENA'S NEIGHBORHOOD CHAMBACU AS A MARGINAL SPACE IN WHICH THE NORMAL RULE OF LAW NO LONGER APPLIES. I ARGUE THAT THE TECHNOLOGIES OF TERROR ENFORCED BY THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT TO THE AFROCOLOMBIANS LIVING IN THE SLUM, REINSCRIBE THE LOGIC OF COLONIAL HIERARCHIES. IN THE NOVEL, THE CHAMBACULEROS' FIGHT FOR THEIR LAND OPENS UP AN OPPORTUNITY FOR POLITICAL EMANCIPATION.
580	TRUST IN THE GOVERNANCE OF TECHNOLOGIES-DISTINCT FROM TRUST IN THE TECHNOLOGIES THEMSELVES-IS A CRITICAL FACTOR IN THE PROTECTION OF SOCIETY AND THE FLOURISHING OF INNOVATION. GOVERNANCE FAILURES-THE RISK MANAGEMENT OF ASBESTOS OR MISMANAGEMENT OF PERSONAL DATA BY FACEBOOK AND CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA AMONG OTHERS-SHOW HOW INADEQUACIES OF GOVERNANCE CAN ERODE TRUST. THIS EROSION CAN HARM NOT ONLY THE DEVELOPMENT OF USEFUL TECHNOLOGIES, BUT ALSO POTENTIALLY THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE THAT PROTECTS THE RULE OF LAW AND FORMS THE BASIS OF MODERN SOCIETIES.
581	AT THE END OF 2015, POLAND'S RULING PARTY DISEMPOWERED THE BROADCASTING COUNCIL USING AN EXPEDITED PROCEDURE. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE PARTY LAW AND JUSTICE BEGAN TO MAKE NEW APPOINTMENTS TO IMPORTANT POSTS IN PUBLIC BROADCASTING. CRITICS IN POLAND AND OTHER EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES SPEAK OF A "FORCING INTO LINE". PUBLIC SERVICE BROADCASTING MAY NOT HAVE BEEN INDEPENDENT BEFORE, SINCE EVERY GOVERNMENT HAS TRIED TO PLACE ASSOCIATED JOURNALISTS IN HIGH POSITIONS IN BROADCASTING. HOWEVER, LAW AND JUSTICE'S COURSE OF ACTION IS A GROSS VIOLATION OF RULE OF LAW.
582	THE EVERY TIME MORE DEEPER CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN THE POLITICAL MODEL ESTABLISHED IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE BOLIVARIAN REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA AND THE POLITICAL ACTION OF GOVERNMENT, ARE CONSEQUENCES OF THE POLITICAL PROJECT THAT RULED IN THE CONSTITUENT NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, INCLUDED THE IDEAS EXPRESSED BY THE LEADER OF THE "BOLIVARIAN REVOLUTION", AND ITS EVOLUTION TOWARDS THE RADICALIZATION OF THE MILITARISM, ANTI-AMERICANISM, POPULISM, SOCIALISM AND FASCISM. THE RESULT IS THE MORE AND MORE PRECARIOUS RULE OF LAW AND THE VIOLATIONS OF CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES AND PRINCIPLES.
583	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES AND DISCUSSES THE MODEL OF LEGISLATIVE POLICY ADOPTED BY SWEDEN IN THE WAKE OF THE 2015 MIGRATION CRISIS. IN PARTICULAR, IT DISCUSSES THE BEST LEGISLATIVE CHANNEL (OR LEGISLATIVE POLICY MODEL) TO DEAL WITH THE CRISIS. USING SWEDEN AS AN EXAMPLE, THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT THE MODEL OF LEGISLATIVE POLICY TO BE PREFERRED IS ONE WHICH MOVES LEGISLATIVE LAW-MAKING PROCESSES CLOSER TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. SHIFTING LAW-MAKING AWAY FROM PUBLIC AGENCIES ALLOWS JUDICIAL BODIES TO DEVELOP A REGULATORY REGIME MORE PROTECTIVE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF PERSONS, IN LINE WITH INTERNATIONAL AND EU LAW. SECTION ONE PRESENTS AN IDEAL-TYPOLOGY OF THREE POSSIBLE MODELS OF LEGISLATIVE POLICY, NAMELY THE ADMINISTRATIVE, THE JUDICIAL, AND THE STATUTORY LEGISLATIVE POLICY MODELS. SECTION TWO OUTLINES THE ADMINISTRATIVE MODEL CHOSEN BY SWEDISH LAW-MAKERS, IN BUILDING THE LEGAL REGIME OF MIGRATION (ALSO DURING THE CRISIS). FINALLY, SECTION THREE POINTS OUT HOW, REGARDLESS OF CONTENT, THE MODALITY CHOSEN IN THE SWEDISH REGULATION SUFFERS FROM SERIOUS DRAWBACK AND HOW, INSTEAD, OPTING FOR A JUDICIAL LEGISLATIVE POLICY WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER SOLUTION.
584	THE CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF LAW HAS LED TO AN INCREASE PROTECTION OF CITIZEN RIGHTS BY THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. AS MEANS OF A HIGHER LEVEL OF PROTECTION, ACT 1437 OF 2011 INTRODUCES THE PROCEDURE OF THE 'EXTENSION OF JURISPRUDENCE', WHICH ENTITLES CITIZENS TO REQUEST ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES TO APPLY TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL CASE THE SAME STANDARD OF PROTECTION THAT WAS AWARDED IN A PRIOR JUDICIAL DECISION, WHEN THAT DECISION CONSTITUTES A UNIFIED PRECEDENT, AND WHEN BOTH CASES HAVE IDENTICAL LEGAL AND FACTUAL GROUNDS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES, WITH THE AID OF THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE COUNCIL OF STATE, THE ORIGINS, REACH AND CONTROVERSIAL ASPECTS SURROUNDING THIS INNOVATIVE LEGAL PROCEDURE.
585	THE ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE MODERN DETERMINANTS OF THE FORMATION AND FUNCTION OF INSTITUTIONS OF THE NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS MECHANISM IN UKRAINE. PARTICULAR ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AS KEY ELEMENTS OF THE NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS MECHANISM, THE FORMATION AND FUNCTIONING OF WHICH, AT THE PRESENT STAGE, ARE DETERMINED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, AT BOTH INTERNAL (NATIONAL) AND EXTERNAL (SUPRANATIONAL) LEVELS. IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT EXTERNAL DETERMINANTS DETERMINE THE IMPACT ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS MECHANISM IN UKRAINE THROUGH FUNCTIONAL INDICATORS OF ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN THE EVALUATION AND REPORTING DOCUMENTS OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE SUPRANATIONAL (INTERNATIONAL) HUMAN RIGHTS MECHANISM. INTERNAL DETERMINANTS DICTATE THE IMPACT ON THE NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS MECHANISM THROUGH FUNCTIONAL INDICATORS OF ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN THE EVALUATION AND REPORTING DOCUMENTS OF NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS, THE RESULTS OF SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH, AND EXPERT ASSESSMENTS AND DEPEND DIRECTLY ON THE `QUALITY OF LAW'. THE CURRENT TRENDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS MECHANISMS IN UKRAINE, WHICH ARE ENSHRINED IN A NUMBER OF CORRESPONDING STRATEGIES IN THE FIELD OF HUMAN RIGHTS DUE TO THE NEED TO IMPROVE THE STATE'S ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE AND ENSURE HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, CREATE EFFECTIVE MECHANISMS FOR THEIR IMPLEMENTATION AND PROTECTION IN THE FIELD OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE, AS WELL AS ITS CONSTITUENT INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE AND THE BAR. EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON THE PRIORITY OF REACHING CONSENSUS AMONG STAKEHOLDERS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE STRATEGIC DOCUMENTS AS A NORMATIVE COMPONENT, WHICH DETERMINES THE DEVELOPMENT TRENDS OF THE INSTITUTIONAL AND FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS OF THE NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS MECHANISM.
586	THE PRESENT WORK IS CONCENTRATED ON THOUGHTS AND PERSPECTIVES OF UNWRITTEN SOFT LAW CODIFICATION MODELS IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE SYSTEM, FOLLOWING AN ESPECIALLY COMPARATIVE AND CRITICAL ANALYSIS WITH THE HARD LAW SYSTEMS AND REGULATORY INTEGRATION IN PRIVATE, EUROPEAN AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW.
587	CONDITIONALITY IS A CONCEPT FREQUENTLY LINKED TO FUNDS RECEIVED FROM INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS BY COUNTRIES IN TROUBLE. MOST CASES DEPEND ON THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES OF THE IMF, BUT ALSO OF OTHER INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE WORLD BANK, ADB, IBD, EIB OR THE EBRD THAT ARE TARGETING THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. BESIDES THE FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK THERE IS ANOTHER APPLICATION OF CONDITIONALITY OFTEN USED BY ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE EU FOR APPLICANT COUNTRIES THAT ARE IN THE EUROPEAN INTEGRATION PROCESS. ALTHOUGH NO REFERENCE WAS MADE TO ANY SPECIFIC CONDITIONALITY CRITERIA IN THE TREATY OF ROME, THE EEC FIRST AND THE EU AFTERWARDS APPLIED A PROCESS OF CONDITIONALITY CRITERIA DURING THE COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES (CEEC) IN THE 80'S. WHILE GENERAL PRINCIPLES WERE DEVELOPED IN INTERNATIONAL FORUM, FROM THE HELSINKI FINAL ACT SIGNED IN 1975, UNTIL THE COPENHAGEN CRITERIA FOR MEMBERSHIP ADOPTED DURING THE JUNE 1993 EUROPEAN COUNCIL, A GREAT EVOLUTION HAS HAPPENED AND EVEN STRICTER CONDITIONS WERE ESTABLISHED IN THE FUTURE WHEN BULGARIA AND ROMANIA BECAME APPLICANT COUNTRIES. ALL THESE TOPICS WILL BE THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT ARTICLE FROM AN INTROSPECTIVE POINT OF VIEW, PROVIDING RELEVANT INFORMATION OF VERY LITTLE KNOWN BUREAUCRATIC PROCEDURES.
588	THE HISTORIOGRAPHY OF THE JURY IS INTERESTINGLY SCHIZOPHRENIC, EVEN PARADOXICAL. ON ONE SIDE IS THE ONCE TRADITIONAL, AND STILL POPULAR, HISTORY OF THE JURY AS PALLADIUM OF LIBERTY. ON THE OTHER SIDE IS THE ONCE REVISIONIST, BUT NOW WIDELY ACCEPTED, ACCOUNT OF THE JURY'S ORIGIN AS INSTRUMENT OF OPPRESSION. ON ONE SIDE IS THE JURY AS ENGLISH, LOCAL, INDIGENOUS, DEMOCRATIC; ON THE OTHER IS THE JURY AS FRENCH, CENTRAL, FOREIGN, AUTOCRATIC. THIS PAPER REFLECTS ON THIS APPARENT PARADOX, REGARDING IT AS NEITHER SUI GENERIS NOR IN NEED OF RESOLUTION. INSTEAD, FROM THE LONGUE DUREE COMPARATIVE-HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE OF NEW HISTORICAL JURISPRUDENCE, THE SCHIZOPHRENIC HISTORY OF THE JURY AND OF OTHER PALLADIA OF LIBERTY, NOTABLY HABEAS CORPUS, CAN BE SEEN TO REFLECT THE FUNDAMENTAL AND LONG-STANDING TENSION BETWEEN TWO MODES OF GOVERNANCE, LAW AND POLICE, ROOTED IN THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN AUTONOMY AND HETERONOMY THAT HAS SHAPED THE WESTERN LEGAL-POLITICAL PROJECT SINCE CLASSICAL ATHENS.
589	THE CIVIL AND COMMERCIAL CODE OF ARGENTINA (CCYC), LAW 26994, WHICH CAME INTO FORCE IN 2015, IS THE RESULT OF CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVATE LAW, INTRODUCING IN THIS CONTEXT, NORMS OF ENORMOUS RELEVANCE TO THE SPECIALTY, INSOFAR AS IT IMPLIES A FORCEFUL RECOGNITION OF THE COMPONENT ENVIRONMENT IN THE RULE OF LAW. THE CCYC CONSTITUTES AN ENORMOUS CONTRIBUTION TO THE UNIFIED CODE FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE ENVIRONMENT (ART. 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 14, 240, 241, 1708, 1710, 1711, 1712, 1713, 1094, 1757 AND 1973).
590	THE ACTIVITY OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH DEPENDS ON THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH IMPLIES THAT IT SHALL ALWAYS BE GROUNDED ON EXISTING LEGISLATION. THIS REQUIREMENT FOR STATE ACTION MAY CAUSE TENSIONS BETWEEN ITS THREE BRANCHES WHEN THE JUDICIARY, IN EXERCISE OF ITS CONSTITUTIONALITY CONTROL, DETERMINES THAT A CERTAIN NORM IS INVALID. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE BETTER PROTECTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS ALONGSIDE WITH THE DUE RESPECT TO DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AT STAKE, THERE SHOULD BE AN ENHANCED DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE BRANCHES INCLUDING SOCIETY IN A SPECIAL POSITION.
591	BOTH DOMESTIC DEMAND AND THE EU ACCESSION PROCESS HAVE TRIGERRED A SIGNIFICANT LEGAL REFORM AGENDA IN TURKEY. SOME IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS ARE ALREADY IN FORCE, BUT THERE ARE STILL A NUMBER OF REFORMS NEEDED. MEANWHILE, NEW CONTROVERSIES HAVE ARISEN, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY AS WELL AS THE WORRISOME QUALITY OF JUSTICE. IMPORTANT INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN NORMATIVE ACTS AND LEGAL PRACTICE ARE THE SUBJECT OF HEATED DISCUSSION, THUS ERODING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE JUDICIARY SYSTEM AND ACCORDINGLY, IN THE RULE OF LAW.
592	SINCE INDEPENDENCE, UKRAINE'S ECONOMY HAS GONE THROUGH A DEEP DEPRESSION FOLLOWED BY SPECTACULAR GROWTH SINCE 1999. AFTER A 50% DECLINE, INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT BOUNCED BACK IN 2006 TO ITS 1990 LEVEL. THIS UPTURN HAS TAKEN PLACE WITHOUT ANY MAJOR INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE, THE RULE OF LAW STILL BEING AS ABSENT AS DURING EARLIER PERIODS. GROWTH RESUMED APPARENTLY THANKS TO CLASSICAL ECONOMIC REFORMS, CONDUCTED IN LINE WITH THE WASHINGTON CONSENSUS AND AFTER MUCH HESITATION. THIS CASE SHOWS THAT GROWTH IS COMPATIBLE WITH A "BAD INSTITUTIONAL EQUILIBRIUM."
593	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE VARIOUS MODELS OF EMERGENCY POWERS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE CONSTITUTIONS AND THE RULE OF LAW. IT TURNS FIRST TO THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF REASON OF STATE DOCTRINES AND JOHN LOCKE TO EXTRALEGAL AND EXTRACONSTITUTIONAL APPROACHES ABOUT THE STATE OF EMERGENCY. TURNING NEXT TO HIGHLIGHT THE WORK AND INFLUENCE OF CARL SCHMITT, THE OUTSTANDING LEGAL THEORIST OF EXCEPTIONALISM, PARTICULARLY REGARDING THE USE OF EXTRAORDINARY TOOLS AGAINST TERRORISM IN THE UNITED STATES. FINALLY IT CONTAINS A SHORT COMMENTARY ON THE SPANISH REGULATION OF EMERGENCY POWERS.
594	THIS PAPER PROPOSES A FRAMEWORK UNDER WHICH THE ICC SHOULD EXERCISE JURISDICTION OVER THE CRIME OF AGGRESSION, IN VIEW OF THE MUCH ANTICIPATED AND IMPENDING REVIEW CONFERENCE OF THE ROME STATUTE. IN THIS CONTEXT, IT EXAMINES THE POTENTIAL INTERACTION BETWEEN THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL, THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT AND THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE, IN AN EVENTUAL PROSECUTORIAL REGIME FOR THE CRIME OF AGGRESSION. THE PAPER'S UNDERLYING PREMISE RESTS ON THE VINDICATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, SO OFTEN DISMISSED IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.
595	THE TALE OF PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS IS, BY NOW, FAMILIAR AND WELL WORN. PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA CRIMINAL SYSTEM OF JUSTICE, WHICH IS CURRENTLY GEARING TOWARDS THE PATHWAY OF PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS, HAS (FOR THE BETTER OR FOR THE WORSE) ATTRACTED A WIDE GLOBAL GAZE. IRRESPECTIVE OF THE UNDERLYING FAIRNESS (OR THE LACK THEREOF) OF THE GRIEVANCES BROUGHT FORTH BY A WORLDWIDE PHALANX OF CRITICS, CHINA IS STEADILY TOILING TOWARDS THE PATH OF PROCEDURAL JUSTICE, WHICH IS ROOTED FIRMLY IN THE RULE OF LAW. WHILST PROCEDURAL JUSTICE AND PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS MAP SEAMLESSLY ON TO THE CONTEXT OF CORPORATE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW, THERE IS BEVY OF CRITICAL QUESTIONS THAT ARE IN DIRE NEED OF BEING CONSISTENTLY ADDRESSED NONETHELESS. ONE WHICH IS WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT POLITICALLY-CHARGED TOOLS, WHICH SEEMINGLY BELIE THE WESTERN-BORNE CONCEPT OF SEPARATION OF POWERS (AS THE SUPREME PEOPLE'S PROCURATORATE GUIDING CASES AND, TO SOME DEGREE, SUPREME PEOPLE'S COURT JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS) ARE AMENABLE TO FORGE THE PATH AHEAD TO MEETING THE FUNDAMENTAL TENETS OF DUE PROCESS IN CORPORATE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW IN MAINLAND CHINA. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, THIS PAPER AIMS TO ANSWER TWO SWEEPING RESEARCH QUESTIONS. FIRSTLY, THE DEGREE TO WHICH CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (AND CORPORATE COMPLIANCE) SUBDUES (AND FOREMOST TRUMPS) CORPORATE CRIMINAL LIABILITY. SECONDLY, WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT SPP GUIDING CASES HAVE CATALYZED A SEISMIC SHIFT IN PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA CRIMINAL PROCEDURAL LAW. CONVERSELY, ONE CENTRAL CONTENTION OF THIS PAPER IS THAT A SET OF FAIRNESS-FRAUGHT COROLLARIES CAN BE WITHDRAWN FROM SPP GUIDING CASES WITH A VIEW TO MAP THE PATH FORWARD TO FULFILLING THE BASELINE STANDARDS OF BOTH PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS AND PROCEDURAL JUSTICE IN PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA CORPORATE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW.
596	IT IS ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE SELECTION AND TRAINING OF JUDGES, THE KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES THEY ACQUIRE DURING THIS PROCESS, ARE DECISIVE TO EFFECTIVELY GUARANTEE THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF CITIZENS AND THE EFFECTIVE DEPLOYMENT OF THE SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC STATE OF LAW ENSHRINED IN THE CONSTITUTION. FOR THIS REASON, IT IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE SOCIAL, CULTURAL, POLITICAL AND GENERATIONAL CHANGES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE AT AN UNPRECEDENTED RATE IN OUR SOCIETY, OF INCONTROVERTIBLE IMPORTANCE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, ARE REFLECTED IN THE KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED BY OUR MODEL OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE. JUDICIARY. A QUESTION THAT MUST BE ANSWERED BY DISCERNING WHAT IS THE JUDICIAL FUNCTION IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE; WHAT LEGAL STATUS PROTECTS THE JUDGE AS A PUBLIC OFFICIAL IN CHARGE OF ADMINISTERING JUSTICE AND HOW JUDICIAL RECRUITMENT HAS DEVELOPED IN SPAIN THROUGHOUT HISTORY, COMPARING IT WITH THE COOPTATION SYSTEMS OF LEGAL SYSTEMS ANALOGOUS TO OURS, BUT ALSO OF A DISSIMILAR NATURE, LIKE THE COMMON LAW. ALL THIS SHOULD ALLOW US, FINALLY, TO REFLECT ON WHETHER OUR CURRENT SYSTEM OF ACCESS TO THE JUDICIAL CAREER IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PRIOR TRAINING OF APPLICANTS, THEIR VITAL AND GENERATIONAL CONTEXT AND THE CANONS OF TRANSPARENCY, EQUALITY, TRANSVERSALITY, GOOD ADMINISTRATION AND EFFICIENCY THAT PERMEATE ANY PUBLIC ACTIVITY IN THE 21ST CENTURY.
597	THE AXIOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS OF MODERN CONSTITUTIONALISM ARE CONSIDERED. THE CONCLUSION BASED ON A STUDY OF WORLD EXPERIENCE IN CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IS MADE THAT THERE IS A GENERAL TREND TO REPLENISH THE VALUE CATALOG OF CONSTITUTIONS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE ACCUMULATED BY STATES AND NATIONAL PRIORITIES. THE PERCEPTION OF NATIONAL VALUES IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL EVOLUTION OF RUSSIA IS TRACED; THE ROLE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, WHICH GIVES IMPETUS TO THE FORMATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONCEPT OF NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY, IS EMPHASIZED. AS A RESULT OF AN INTERDISCIPLINARY ANALYSIS, INCLUDING THE METHODOLOGY OF HISTORICAL, PHILOSOPHICAL, AND LEGAL SCIENCES, AN ASSESSMENT IS GIVEN OF CHANGES TO THE BASIC LAW OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IN 2020, WHICH IN THEIR SIGNIFICANCE AND DEPTH ARE CLOSE TO CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM. THE CONTENT OF AMENDMENTS TO THE 1993 CONSTITUTION IS ANALYZED. THE AMENDMENTS WILL COME INTO FORCE BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE ALL-RUSSIAN VOTE. THE RUSSIAN BASIC LAW IS NOTED TO HAVE ACQUIRED THE PROPERTIES OF A PROGRAM DOCUMENT, EDUCATIONAL-MOTIVATING ATTITUDES, AND A PRONOUNCED SOCIO-VALUE FILLING. THE AMENDMENTS CONSOLIDATE THE EXISTING MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE STATE AND ITS CITIZENS IN RELATION TO BASIC VALUES, AS A RESULT OF WHICH THE CONSTITUTION BECOMES A MORAL REFERENCE POINT FOR RUSSIAN SOCIETY, REFLECTING ITS IDEALS AND TRADITIONAL FEATURES OF COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS. AT THE SAME TIME, IN THE PROCESS OF CONSTITUTIONAL IMPROVEMENT OF THE MECHANISMS OF PUBLIC AUTHORITY, RUSSIA IS DEVELOPING ITS OWN NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL MODEL, CORRESPONDING TO THE DOMESTIC MENTALITY AND NEW REQUIREMENTS OF STATE SECURITY. IN GENERAL, THIS SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A MULTICIVILIZATIONAL MODEL OF THE WORLD STRUCTURE, WHICH IMPLIES THE EQUALITY OF DIFFERENT CULTURES AND CIVILIZATIONS AND THE DIVERSITY OF NATIONAL SOCIOCULTURAL VALUES.
598	IN THIS MOMENT OF POPULIST MISTRUST OF GLOBALIZATION AND AMID ATTACKS ON LIBERAL VALUES OF DEMOCRACY, HOW CAN WE BEST TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION PROFESSIONALS TO SERVE A CITIZENRY CYNICAL ABOUT DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE? THE ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE TRANSNATIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF GLOBAL ETHIC OF PUBLIC SERVICE FOUNDED ON THE DEMOCRATIC VALUES OF THE RULE OF LAW AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS THAT ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT TO DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE, LEGITIMATE, AND TRANSPARENT SKILLSETS THAT PROMOTE TRUST IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE.
599	A MINIMAL, REASONABLY UNCONTROVERSIAL DEMAND OF ANY LEGAL SYSTEM IS THAT IT SHOULD STABILIZE A POLITY AGAINST BOTH THE CHANCE HAZARDS OF ORDINARY VIOLENCE AND SUDDEN BLOWS OF EXTRAORDINARY, DESTABILIZING MISFORTUNE. LAW IN THE CONTEMPORARY UNITED STATES, THOUGH, HAS NOT SO FAR ABATED THE LETHAL TOLL OF VIOLENT CRIME, THE SERIAL MASS SHOOTINGS OF CHILDREN, THE ENDLESS FLOW OF RACIALIZED POLICE VIOLENCE, OR EVEN THE TOLL OF INSURRECTIONARY VIOLENCE SHADOWING DEMOCRATIC POLITICS. THE GAP BETWEEN LAW'S OPERATION IN PRACTICE AND ITS ULTIMATE ASPIRATIONS TOWARD SOCIAL ORDER-ESPECIALLY FOR THE SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY MARGINAL-OFFERS A HINT THAT SOMETHING IN OUR DOMINANT WORKING MODEL OF LAW, OR ITS RELATION TO AN IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW, IS AWRY OR INACCURATE.THIS BOOK REVIEW RECONSIDERS SOME PRESENTLY DOMINANT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOW A WELL-FUNCTIONING LEGAL SYSTEM WORKS IN LIGHT OF NEW EVIDENCE OF HOW LAW HAS OPERATED ACROSS A WIDE HISTORICAL AND GEOGRAPHIC PANORAMA. THIS EXERCISE IN HISTORICAL AND CROSS-CULTURAL CONTEXTUALIZATION HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR CHOICE OF A SOUND WORKING DEFINITION OF LAW, AND FOR A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE LATTER'S RELATIONSHIP TO BROADER RULE-OF-LAW AMBITIONS. IT ALSO BEARS ON WHETHER LAW IS LIKELY TO ADVANCE OR RETARD EMANCIPATORY PROJECTS OF SOCIAL REFORM, ESPECIALLY THOSE PERTAINING TO RACIAL INJUSTICE. THE SPUR FOR THIS RECONSIDERATION IS PROFESSOR FERNANDA PIRIE'S BOOK, THE RULE OF LAWS: A 4,000-YEAR QUEST TO ORDER THE WORLD, AN EXTRAORDINARY AND AMBITIOUS EFFORT TO FUSE HISTORICAL, ANTHROPOLOGICAL, SOCIOLOGICAL, AND LEGAL LEARNING ACROSS CONTINENTS AND ERAS INTO A SINGLE NARRATIVE ARC. STARTING WITH THE HISTORICAL MATERIALS ELOQUENTLY MARSHALLED BY PIRIE, I REFINE A NEW "POLYTHETIC " DEFINITION OF LAW THAT IS DISTINCT AND DIFFERENT FROM THE DEMOTIC DEFINITION OF LAW COMMONLY USED IN POPULAR AND JURISTIC DISCOURSE ALIKE. TO ILLUMINATE ITS DISTINCTIVE FORM AND IMPLICATIONS, I BRING THIS POLYTHETIC DEFINITION INTO CONVERSATION WITH RELEVANT ELEMENTS OF THE LEADING JURISPRUDENTIAL THEORIES OF H.L.A. HART AND LON L. FULLER. THIS IS DONE WITH THE AIM OF SPARKING NEW WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT THE RELATION OF LAW TO THE STATE ON THE ONE HAND, AND ABOUT LEGALISTIC ASPIRATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW ON THE OTHER. IN CONCLUDING, I CONSIDER THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE POLYTHETIC DEFINITION OF LAW FOR ONE ESPECIALLY PRESSING CONTEMPORARY PROBLEM-THE QUESTION OF HOW LAW RELATES TO PROJECTS OF MAINTAINING RACIAL HIERARCHIES OR REALIZING THEIR REFORM.
600	ROMANIA AND BULGARIA ENCOUNTER TODAY PROBLEMS IN JOINING THE VISA-FREE SCHENGEN AREA. THE MAIN ONE IN THE PUBLIC EYE IS CORRUPTION. BOTH COUNTRIES PLEDGED TO IMPROVE THEIR RULE OF LAW WHEN SIGNING THEIR ACCESSION TREATIES IN 2005, YET LITTLE PROGRESS IS PERCEIVED BY OBSERVERS OR CAPTURED WITH GOVERNANCE MEASUREMENTS RELYING ON PERCEPTION, SUCH AS CPI AND WORLD BANK GOVERNANCE INDICATORS. THIS PAPER EXPLORES REAL POLICY, WITH FACT-BASED INDICATORS, TO TRACE PROGRESS IN THE AREA - OR LACK OF IT - SINCE 2004 TO THE PRESENT.
601	EUROPEAN CRIMINAL JUSTICE IS NOT ONLY ABOUT HARMONIZATION AND EUROPEANIZATION OF THE DOMESTIC CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS BUT ALSO ABOUT COMMON CRIMINAL POLICIES AND SHARED VALUES, INCLUDING KEY VALUES RELATED TO THE RULE OF LAW. WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED IN THE EUROPEAN INTEGRATION PROCESS AND WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES AHEAD OF US? THE AUTHOR ASSESSES THIS IN THE AREA OF HARMONIZATION OF SUBSTANTIVE CRIMINAL LAW AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE; MUTUAL RECOGNITION; EUROPEAN JUDICIAL AGENCIES AND THE EXTERNAL DIMENSION OF THE AREA OF FREEDOM, SECURITY AND JUSTICE.
602	GOOD GOVERNANCE IS IMPORTANT FOR DEVELOPMENT DESPITE DIFFERENCES IN THE WAY IT IS DEFINED. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CONCEPT OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AND ANALYZES ITS USE BY DEVELOPMENTAL AID DONOR ORGANIZATIONS. THE STUDY REVEALS THAT DONORS HAVE CONFLICTING IDEAS ABOUT GOOD GOVERNANCE THAT CONVERGE AROUND FIVE PRINCIPLES: ACCOUNTABILITY, EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS, OPENNESS AND TRANSPARENCY, PARTICIPATION, AND RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH A CRITICAL REFLECTION ON THE USE OF THE CONCEPT BY AID DONORS AND WARNS AGAINST TREATING IT AS A ONE-BEST-WAY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY.
603	THERE IS AMPLE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE OF A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ASPECTS OF INSTITUTIONAL UNCERTAINTY AND INVESTMENT. MOST STUDIES, HOWEVER, DO NOT ALLOW A COMPARISON BETWEEN DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF SUCH UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE THEY FOCUS ON SPECIFIC INDICATORS, PARTICULAR REGIONS OR DIFFERENT PERIODS. THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH AN EVALUATION OF THE QUANTITATIVE EFFECTS OF THE SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY INDICATORS ON INVESTMENT FINDING THAT A LACK OF RULE OF LAW, HIGH CORRUPTION, AND VOLATILITY IN REAL EXCHANGE RATE DISTORTIONS ARE THE MOST DETRIMENTAL FOR INVESTMENT. JEL NO. E22, O11
604	THE PROBLEM OF INSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATIONS AND THEIR IMPACT ON LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS CONSIDERED. THE THESIS ON THE CONTINUING CONFLICT BETWEEN TRADITION AND THE RULE OF LAW IN PRACTICE OF PUBLIC LAWMAKING IS JUSTIFIED. THE AUTHORS REACH THE CONCLUSION ABOUT DUAL (BINARY) NATURE OF TODAY'S LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND TRANSITION STATE OF THE SYSTEM OF RELATIONS BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL AND GOVERNMENT. THE MAIN PROBLEMS OF IMPROVING THE SENSE OF JUSTICE OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE TRANSITION TO THE SYSTEM OF SOCIAL PARTNERSHIP ARE STRUCTURED.
605	JUDGES OCCUPY IMPORTANT ROLES IN ROUSSEAU'S CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY. PLACING THE SOCIAL CONTRACT ALONGSIDE ROUSSEAU'S LESSER-KNOWN LETTERS WRITTEN FROM THE MOUNTAIN AND THE GOVERNMENT OF POLAND, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW ROUSSEAU CONSTRUCTS JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS AND EXPLORES A PROBLEM HE CONFRONTS. ALTHOUGH NECESSARY FOR THE REPUBLIC TO ENJOY THE RULE OF LAW, ROUSSEAU WORRIES THAT ADJUDICATIVE BODIES THREATEN THE CITIZENS' FREEDOM. THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES ROUSSEAU'S CONSTITUTIONAL SOLUTION, WHICH COMBINES A CONSERVATIVE-YET-PROGRESSIVE LEGISLATIVE ETHOS, WITH PLURALIST INSTITUTIONALISM AND JUDICIAL NON-PROFESSIONALISM.
606	RETROACTIVE JUSTICE AGAINST PERTRATORS IN POST-TOTALITARIAN, AS DISTINCT OF POST-AUTHORITARIAN, DEMOCRACIES IS CONSTRAINED BY THE ABSENCE OF HUMAN RESOURCES FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND THE WEAKNESS OF CIVIL SOCIETY THE LIMITED APPLICATION OF LUSTRATION AND OTHER SANCTIONS IN POSTCOMMUNIST COUNTRIES IS UNDERSTOOD IN THE CONTEXT OF POLITICS OF TRANSITION, POLITICAL ACTORS, MOTIVATIONS, CONSTRAINTS AND BELIEFS. WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE CZECH REPUBLIC, THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF LUSTRATION IS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE DAMAGE INFLICTED ON POST-COMMUNIST SOCIETIES BY THE NOMENKLATURA AND THE FORMER SECRET POLICE.
607	AFTER TRACING THE SOCIAL, INTELLECTUAL, AND POLITICAL ORIGINS OF CHILE'S DEMAND FOR A NEW CONSTITUTION (WHICH STARTED IN CIRCUMSCRIBED CIRCLES AS EARLY AS THE LATE 1990S, BUT GOT MOMENTUM TOWARDS THE END OF THE 2000S), THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE SEMISOVEREIGN DEMOCRACY ESTABLISHED BY THE CONSTITUTION OF 1980, A FEATURE DESIGNED BY ITS FRAMERS TO PREVENT THE DISMANTLING OF THE PARTICULARLY RADICAL VERSION OF NEOLIBERAL ECONOMICS LEFT IN PLACE BY THE MILITARY REGIME. THEN, THE PIECE ANALYSES HOW THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S CONSERVATIVE JURISPRUDENCE CONTRIBUTED TO MAKE CLEAR TO MOST CHILEANS THE LINK BETWEEN AN INCREASINGLY UNPOPULAR ECONOMIC MODEL AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATUS QUO, SOMETHING WHICH, IN TURN, LED PRESIDENT BACHELET TO ATTEMPT TO INTRODUCE A NEW CHARTER IN HER SECOND ADMINISTRATION (AN EFFORT WHICH FAILED DUE TO THE REFUSAL OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTIES TO REPLACE A FUNDAMENTAL LAW THAT WAS, IN FACT, LARGELY BIASED TOWARDS THEIR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC IDEAS). THE SECOND HALF OF THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO ANALYSE THE WAY IN WHICH THE SOCIAL UPRISING OF OCTOBER-DECEMBER 2019 TRANSFORMED THE OLD DEMAND FOR A NEW CONSTITUTION INTO A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONAL WAY TO CHANNEL WHAT AT THE TIME SEEMED TO BE A POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CRISIS. NOTING THE-RATHER IMPRESSIVE-CAPACITY OF THE POLITICAL PARTY SYSTEM TO AGREE ON THE PATH TOWARDS A NEW CHARTER, THE ARTICLE THEN ARGUES THAT CHILE'S HIGHLY REGULATED CONSTITUTION-MAKING PROCESS REPRESENTS AN INSTANCE OF WHAT COLON-RIOS (2020) CALLS A 'PROCEDURALLY REGULATED' ONE, THAT IS, ONE WHERE AN EXISTING CONSTITUTION IS AMENDED TO AUTHORIZE ITS COMPLETE REPLACEMENT ACCORDING TO THE PROCEDURES IT ESTABLISHES, BUT LEAVING THE CONSTITUENT BODY LEEWAY TO AUTONOMOUSLY DECIDE ON THE CONTENT OF THE NEW CHARTER. WHILE IN TENSION WITH TRADITIONAL UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE EXERCISE OF THE CONSTITUENT POWER IN CASES OF COMPLETE CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE, THIS FEATURE OF CHILE'S ONGOING CONSTITUTION-MAKING PROCESS REPRESENTS A PROMISING PATH TO INTRODUCE A NEW CONSTITUTION IN A MANNER THAT PROMOTES THE RULE OF LAW.
608	IN CONTRAST TO THE THESIS THAT THE DOCTRINE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS HAS ITS SOURCE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT, AFFIRMED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A "PROJECT" THAT SEEKS TO DISCOVER THE RELATION BETWEEN CONSTITUTIONALISM AND CHRISTIANITY, THIS ARTICLE STATES THAT THIS DOCTRINE, AS A NECESSARY ELEMENT OF A CONSTITUTIONAL AND DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW SATE, HAS AS ITS PRIMARY PRESUPPOSITION THE PROCESS OF MODERNITY, IN THE SENSE OF OVERCOMING MEDIEVAL THEOCENTRICISM, ON THE ONE HAND, AND THE STRUGGLE AGAINST ABSOLUTE AND DESPOTIC POWER, ON THE OTHER.
609	TRANSNATIONAL CIVIC EDUCATION AS DEFINED HERE REFERS TO THE SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF NATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AS THEY STRUGGLE WITH LAWLESSNESS AND RECOVER GOVERNANCE VALUES AND IDEAS CONSISTENT WITH HUMAN DIGNITY AND THE RULE OF LAW. ANALYTICAL REASONING IS HERALDED AS ONE APPROACH TO DISSECTING NATIONS' CIVIC CULTURES. ONE HUNDRED PALESTINIAN TEACHERS EXAMINED THE CIVIC EDUCATION DOCUMENTS AND PRACTICES OF SEVEN NATIONS, INCLUDING ROMANIA, THE UNITED STATES, AND PALESTINE. THEY READ ORIGINAL LEGAL TEXTS, CONDUCTED ORAL HISTORIES, LEARNED CONTENT ANALYSIS, AND LEARNED HORIZONTAL HUMAN RIGHTS DEBATE PRACTICES.
610	THIS ARTICLE INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING PARTS, WHETHER LEGISLATION IS NECESSARY AND THE PURPOSES OF LEGISLATION, WHY LEGISLATION IS NECESSARY AND THE NEED OF LEGISLATION, WHAT KIND OF LEGISLATION AND THE HOW TO LEGISLATE AND THE WAY OF LEGISLATION , SPECIAL 7:0,112 OF RELIGION. AS A TTUGGC T ION OF THE TRANSITION FROM AD RATION TO THE RULE OF LAW. AND TIN CONCLUSION IS THAT LEGISLATION OF RELIGIONS IN CHINA IS IMPERATIVE, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY DIFFICULTIES, OTHERWISE .01- PROBLEMS OF RELIGIONS CANNOT BE SOLVED.
611	YU KEPING, KEY POINTS OF THE DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION FOR AROUND THIRTY YEARS, POLITICAL REFORM IN CHINA HAS ESSENTIALLY TAKEN THE FORM OF REFORMS OF THE ADMINISTRATION. THUS A PARTICULAR FORM OF DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION HAS BEGUN TO TAKE SHAPE. REFORMS HAS THE GOAL OF ENSURING DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, EQUALITY; RESPONSIBILITY, TRANSPARENCY, INTEGRITY, EFFICIENCY AND HARMONY. IT WILL CONSIST IN THE FOLLOWING KEY POINTS: SOCIAL JUSTICE, PUBLIC SERVICES, SOCIAL HARMONY, INTEGRITY OF CIVIL SERVANTS, GOVERNMENTAL INNOVATION, DEMOCRACY WITHIN THE PARTY, DEMOCRACY AT THE BASE AND ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY.
612	IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY (1513), THE DOCTRINE OF "ROYAL ABSOLUTISM", PROPOSED BY N. MACHIAVELLI IN THE PRINCE AND THEN SUPPORTED BY THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION, WAS CONTRASTED BY THE REPUBLICAN DOCTRINE OF "SOCIAL CONTRACT", FORMULATED BY M. SALAMONE IN THE PRINCIPALITY. THIS DOCTRINE WAS FURTHER SUPPORTED BY THE SPANISH JESUITS AS F.SUAREZ, AND THE FRENCH OR GERMAN CALVINISTS AS J. ALTHUSIUS, WHOSE WILL DEFEND THE PRINCIPLE OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY, THAT IS TO SAY THE ETHICAL-LEGAL FOUNDATION OF POLITICAL POWER, OR THE RULE OF LAW, AGAINST THEOCRACY
613	EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE IS CRUCIAL FOR BUILDING ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES IN ORDER TO DISCOURAGE NON-RENEWABLE ENERGY USE AND REPLACE IT BY RENEWABLE RESOURCES. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF FOSSIL FUELS IN THE EXISTING ENERGY MIX OF ASEAN COUNTRIES, THE TRANSITION TO RENEWABLE ENERGY IS CRITICAL FOR EMISSIONS TO BE REDUCED IN THIS REGION. AS A PIONEERING ONE, THE PRESENT STUDY FOCUSES ON THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE INDICATORS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN ENERGY TRANSITION IN SOUTHEAST ASIAN (ASEAN) COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 2000-2020. FOR THE PURPOSE OF EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION, THE STUDY APPLIES THE RECENTLY INTRODUCED METHODS OF MOVEMENT QUANTILE REGRESSION (MMQR) WITH FE-OLS, DOLS, AND FMOLS ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES. THE FINDINGS OF INDICATE THAT ECONOMIC GROWTH SIGNIFICANTLY PROMOTES ENERGY TRANSITION IN ASEAN COUNTRIES. AMONG THE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, POLITICAL STABILITY, RULE OF LAW, AND REGULATORY QUALITY SIGNIFICANTLY AND POSITIVELY AFFECT ENERGY TRANSITION, WHEREAS GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION PLAY NEGATIVE ROLES IN ENERGY TRANSITION. VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON ENERGY TRANSITION. POLITICAL STABILITY AND RULE OF LAW PLAY SIGNIFICANT ROLES IN ENERGY TRANSITION AT ALL QUANTILES, BUT POLITICAL STABILITY HAS A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON ENERGY TRANSITION ONLY AT HIGHER QUANTILES (0.60-0.90). SIMILARLY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION NEGATIVELY IMPACT ENERGY TRANSITION AT MEDIUM TO HIGHER (0.50-0.90) AND AT HIGHER QUANTILES (0.80-0.90), RESPECTIVELY. POLICIES ARE RECOMMENDED ON THE BASIS OF THE FINDINGS.
614	STRONG INSTITUTIONS ARE A PREREQUISITE TO GOOD GOVERNANCE AND A CRITICAL ASPECT OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE INDEPENDENCE OF A LEGALLY QUALIFIED JUDICIARY AND THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF GOVERNMENT ARE THE CUMULATIVE RESULT OF MANY CENTURIES OF PROGRESS. RECENT REFORMS TO THE LEGISLATURE, THE JUDICIARY, AND THE EXECUTIVE IN QUEENSLAND PLACE THESE IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES UNDER THREAT. THIS ARTICLE PLACES THESE REFORMS IN THEIR HISTORICAL CONTEXT TO ILLUSTRATE THAT THEY WEAKEN THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE STATE IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH THE COURSE OF HISTORY.
615	A SYSTEMATIC CROSS-COUNTRY ANALYSIS OF E-COMMERCE ACTIVITY REVEALS THAT ALTHOUGH PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE EXPLAINS MUCH OF THE VARIATION IN BASIC INTERNET USE, E-COMMERCE ACTIVITY ALSO DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON A SUPPORTIVE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT. CHIEF AMONG THE CHARACTERISTICS OF SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT ARE NATIONAL RESPECT FOR THE "RULE OF LAW" AND, SECONDARILY, THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIBLE PAYMENT CHANNELS SUCH AS CREDIT CARDS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT AN INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT THAT FACILITATES THE BUILDING OF TRANSACTIONAL INTEGRITY IS CRITICAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF E-COMMERCE.
616	THIS ARTICLE WILL FOCUS ON TWO RECENT CASES REFERRED FROM THE IRISH COURTS TO THE CJEU: MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY V CELMER AND MINISTER FOR JUSTICE, EQUALITY AND LAW REFORM V RO. WHILE BOTH CASES CONTRIBUTE IN DIFFERENT WAYS TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE EUROPEAN HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION SYSTEM, THEY ALSO SUGGEST A NEED FOR FURTHER DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE CJEU AND DOMESTIC COURTS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE SYNERGIES BETWEEN THE CJEU AND THE ECTHR.
617	IN CHINA, INTERPROVINCIAL BORDER AREAS COULD BECOME A DESTABILIZING SOURCE FOR BOTH SOCIAL STABILITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. ONE OF THE MOST TYPICAL CASES HAS BEEN THAT OF BOUNDARY DISPUTES STEMMING FROM INACCURATE BORDERLINES BETWEEN PROVINCES. THIS ARTICLE, BASED ON FIELD SURVEYS AND RELEVANT OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS, SHOWS THAT THE INTERPROVINCIAL TENSIONS AT LAKE WEISHAN HAVE BEEN AGGRAVATED BY THE AMBIGUITY IN THE INTERPROVINCIAL DELIMITATION, A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW ON INTERPROVINCIAL RELATIONS, AND, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, NEPOTISM FROM BOTH CENTRAL AND PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS.
618	THIS ARTICLE USES A MULTIPLE INDICATORS MULTIPLE CAUSES (MIMIC) MODEL TO ANALYSE THE DETERMINANTS OF SMUGGLING. THE ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT HIGHER CORRUPTION AND A LOWER RULE OF LAW ENCOURAGE SMUGGLING. TARIFFS AND TRADE RESTRICTIONS ARE IMPORTANT PUSH FACTORS, WHILE A HIGHER BLACK MARKET PREMIUM (BMP) DISCOURAGES SMUGGLERS. BASED ON THE MIMIC ESTIMATES, WE CALCULATE AN INDEX OF SMUGGLING WHICH PROVIDES A RANKING FOR 54 COUNTRIES. WE FIND THAT SMUGGLING IS RAMPANT IN CAMEROON, PAKISTAN AND KENYA WHILE IT IS LEAST PREVALENT IN SWITZERLAND, FINLAND AND SWEDEN.
619	TO ANALYSE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA AND INDIA, THE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (INCLUDING VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AS WELL AS CONTROL OF CORRUPTION) IN THESE TWO COUNTRIES ARE FORECASTED BY THE FRACTIONAL ORDER ACCUMULATION GREY NUMBER MODEL, IN THE CURRENT STUDY. THE VARIATION TREND OF SIX INDICATORS WILL KEEP GENTLE GROWTH OR A SLIGHT DECREASE, EXCEPT FOR THE GOVERNANCE INDICATOR OF CONTROL CORRUPTION SHOWS A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE. OUR RESULTS CAN PROVIDE REFERENCES FOR POLICY MAKERS, EXPERTS AND INVESTORS.
620	THIS ARTICLE DRAWS ATTENTION TO THE SURVIVAL IN THE LEGAL SYSTEMS OF INDIA AND HONG KONG OF THE ANCIENT DOCTRINE OF CROWN IMMUNITY. IN INDIA THE 'SOVEREIGN POWERS' OF THE EAST INDIA COMPANY VEST IN THE INDIAN STATE AND IT CONSEQUENTLY ENJOYS SUBSTANTIAL IMMUNITY. IN HONG KONG A RECENT CASE HOLDS THAT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT ENJOYS THE SAME IMMUNITY AS THE CROWN. SUCH IMMUNITIES ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND SHOULD BE NARROWED BY JUDICIAL DECISION IN THE ABSENCE OF REMEDIAL LEGISLATION.
621	THE CURRENT NON-PUBLICATION OF THE TRAVAUX PREPARATOIRES OF THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE RULES OF COURT IS NOT EASY TO JUSTIFY. THERE ARE CONCRETE EXAMPLES IN WHICH THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE MATERIALS WILL AID THE INTERPRETATION OF THE RULES. FURTHERMORE, BROADER CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS THE SPIRIT OF THE STATUTE, THE PREVAILING TREND IN THE WORLD, THE NEED TO PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW, TO INSPIRE GREATER CONFIDENCE IN THE COURT AND TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY IN LITIGATION BEFORE THE COURT ALL MILITATE IN FAVOUR OF PUBLICATION.
622	DECISION OF THE AUSTRIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF OCTOBER 15, 2004(1)-ASYLUM-PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW-PROHIBITION OF TORTURE OR INHUMAN OR DEGRADING TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT (ARTICLE 3 ECHR)(2)-RIGHT TO LIBERTY (ARTICLE 5 ECHR, ARTICLE 1 PERSONENFREIHEITSG)(3)-RIGHT TO RESPECT FOR PRIVATE AND FAMILY LIFE (ARTICLE 8 ECHR)-RIGHT TO AN EFFECTIVE REMEDY (ARTICLE 13 ECHR)-PROHIBITION OF COLLECTIVE EXPULSION OF ALIENS (ARTICLE 4 OF PROTOCOL NO. 4 ECHR)-RIGHT TO THE PROTECTION OF PROPERTY (ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 ECHR).
623	A CONCERN WAS VOICED IN COMMENTARIES AFTER THE PSPP JUDGMENT THAT THE BVERFG'S POSITION REGARDING THE REFUSAL TO APPLY IN GERMANY THE CJEU JUDGMENT AS ISSUED ON AN ULTRA VIRES BASIS MIGHT BE USED IN EU MEMBER STATES INFRINGING THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY IN PARTICULAR. THIS ISSUE IS PRESENTED IN RELATION TO POLAND. THE ARTICLE SETS OUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS WHICH PROCLAIM OPENNESS TO EUROPEAN INTEGRATION, AS WELL AS THE UNION-FRIENDLY CASE-LAW OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL (CT) UNTIL 2016. THE CT JURISPRUDENCE AT THAT TIME PROVIDED, HOWEVER, FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF REFUSING TO APPLY EU LAW IN EXCEPTIONAL SITUATIONS, EVEN THOUGH THIS NEVER HAPPENED. NEXT, THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES ENDEAVORS OF THE NEW POLISH AUTHORITIES SINCE THE END OF 2015 WHICH DRASTICALLY BREACH THE RULE OF LAW IN THE FIELD OF THE JUDICIARY, AS WELL AS THE MEASURES TAKEN BY EU INSTITUTIONS TO COUNTERACT THESE ADVERSE PHENOMENA. THE POLISH AUTHORITIES ARGUE THAT THE COMPETENCE TO DEFINE THE LEGAL POSITION OF THE JUDICIARY HAS NOT BEEN CONFERRED ON THE UNION AND REMAINS WITHIN THE EXCLUSIVE COMPETENCE OF THE MEMBER STATES. SUCH A STANCE WAS ALSO TAKEN BY THE POLITICALLY DEPENDENT CT IN APRIL 2020. THE PSPP JUDGMENT WAS THEREFORE WELCOMED WITH JOY BY POLISH POLITICIANS. THERE ARE MAJOR DIFFERENCES, HOWEVER, BETWEEN THE RULINGS OF THE BVERFG AND THOSE OF THE POLISH CT IN ITS CURRENT COMPOSITION, AND THE HOPES PINNED ON THE PSPP JUDGMENT BY THE POLISH AUTHORITIES ARE UNFOUNDED.
624	AMIDST THE RISE OF A NEW COLD WAR BETWEEN CHINA AND THE US, HONG KONG HAS BEEN CALLED GROUND ZERO, THE NEW BERLIN, OR THE GLOBAL FRONTIER BY VARIOUS MEDIA OUTLETS. DURING AN ONGOING US-CHINA TRADE WAR, THE WATER MOVEMENT BROKE OUT IN 2019. IT WAS THE LARGEST AND MOST PROLONGED SOCIAL MOVEMENT THAT HONG KONG HAS SEEN, AND ONE THAT WAS MET WITH THE DIREST CONSEQUENCE - THE IMPOSITION OF A SWEEPING NATIONAL SECURITY LAW THAT HAS CHANGED THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE OF HONG KONG. SOON AFTER THE SOCIAL MOVEMENT ERUPTED, THE SONG GLORY TO HONG KONG GAINED HUGE POPULARITY AND CAME TO BE KNOWN UNOFFICIALLY AS THE 'NATIONAL ANTHEM' OF HONG KONG. IT HAS BEEN SUNG REGULARLY AT PROTESTS, WITH MANY LANGUAGE VERSIONS BEING CIRCULATED ON YOUTUBE. TAKING A SOCIAL SEMIOTIC APPROACH, THIS PAPER INTERPRETS THE MEANING OF THIS PROTEST ANTHEM, TEASING OUT ITS MULTIMODAL LAYERS AND ANALYSING ITS PRODUCTION, LYRICS, MUSICAL FORM, DIGITAL RENDITIONS, AND LIVE PERFORMANCES IN LIGHT OF THE EVOLVING SOCIO-POLITICAL SITUATION AT THE TIME. THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT CERTAIN RENDITIONS OF THE SONG EXPRESSED NOT ONLY POLITICAL DEFIANCE BUT ALSO A BUDDING NATIONAL IMAGINATION AS A ROUTE OF REDRESSING INJUSTICE, AS DISAPPOINTMENT IN RULE OF LAW GREW; HOWEVER, IDEOLOGICAL COHESION AMONG MOVEMENT PARTICIPANTS REMAINED LIMITED. ALTHOUGH THE NATIONAL SECURITY LAW HAS SUCCESSFULLY QUENCHED SUCH POLITICAL EXPRESSIONS, CONFIDENCE IN THE RULE OF LAW HAS TO BE RESTORED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A MUCH-NEEDED PRESSURE VALVE FOR HONG KONG.
625	PURPOSE - THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF GOVERNANCE INDICES (ESPECIALLY CONTROL OF CORRUPTION) ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN SOME SELECTED SUB-SAHARA AFRICAN (SSA) COUNTRIES WITH A VIEW TO MAKING POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS. SPECIFICALLY, THE STUDY ATTEMPTS TO ASSESS WHETHER EITHER GOVERNANCE REFORMS (ESPECIALLY THOSE RELATING TO CONTROL OF CORRUPTION) OR SIMULTANEOUS POLICY REFORMS COULD HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE GROWTH OF THE SAMPLE SSA COUNTRIES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS USED IN THIS STUDY WERE DRAWN FROM THE PRS GROUP AND THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS FOR 2002-2009, WHILE THE REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) PER CAPITA GROWTH DATA WERE OBTAINED FROM THE WORLD BANK DATABASE. THE STUDY COVERED 47 SSA COUNTRIES, AND IT ADOPTED THE PANEL DATA FRAMEWORK, THE FIXED EFFECT, THE RANDOM EFFECT AND THE MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES FOR THE ANALYSES. FINDINGS - THE STUDY FOUND THAT POLITICAL STABILITY AND REGULATORY QUALITY INDICATORS HAVE GROWTH-ENHANCING FEATURES, AS THEY IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE REGION SIGNIFICANTLY, WHILE GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS IMPACTS NEGATIVELY ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE REGION. DESPITE, SEVERAL ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICIES IN THE REGION, THE IMPACT OF CORRUPTION CONTROL ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IS NOT VERY OBVIOUS. THE STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT SIMULTANEOUS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW INDICATORS HAS MORE POSITIVE IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE REGION. BOTH POLICIES ARE COMPLEMENTARY, AND, HENCE, CAN BE PURSUED SIMULTANEOUSLY. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT REFORM EFFORTS THAT AIM AT ENHANCING ACCOUNTABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW HAVE MORE GROWTH-ENHANCING FEATURES AND, THUS, SHOULD BE GIVEN MORE PRIORITY OVER REFORM EFFORTS THAT SINGLY ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF CONTROL OF CORRUPTION DUE TO THE ENDEMIC, SYSTEMIC AND UBIQUITOUS NATURE OF CORRUPTION IN THE REGION. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT REFORM EFFORTS THAT AIM AT ENHANCING ACCOUNTABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW HAVE MORE GROWTH-ENHANCING FEATURES AND, THEREFORE, SHOULD BE GIVEN MORE PRIORITY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - MANY PREVIOUS STUDIES ATTEMPTED TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF CORRUPTION ON ECONOMIES, BUT THIS PAPER TRIES TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF CORRUPTION CONTROL AND OTHER GOVERNANCE INDICES ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE MOST VULNERABLE REGION OF THE WORLD, THE SSA. BESIDES, THE STUDY ADOPTS THE PANEL DATA FRAMEWORK WHICH MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO ALLOW FOR DIFFERENCES IN THE FORM OF UNOBSERVABLE INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY EFFECTS.
626	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE NATURE AND TENDENCIES IN HOW THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE'S ATTITUDES ARE SHIFTING WHEN IT COMES TO LAW ABIDANCE, EXAMINING HOW VIEWS HAVE EVOLVED ON THE RULE OF LAW, LAW ABIDANCE, JUSTICE, AND OTHER SUCH VIEWS WHICH REFLECT THE NATURE OF LEGAL AWARENESS, AMONG CITIZENS OF VARIOUS AGES (THE MAIN FOCUS BEING YOUNG PEOPLE). THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON DATA FROM THE RUSSIAN LONGITUDINAL MONITORING SURVEY (RLMS-HSE). THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY REVEAL THAT MORE RUSSIAN PEOPLE ARE RECOGNIZING THE TRUE VALUE OF THE LAW, AS WELL AS THE INCREASING WILLINGNESS OF SUCH LAW-ABIDING PEOPLE TO COMPLY WITH LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. HOWEVER, DESPITE THESE POSITIVE SHIFTS, RUSSIAN SOCIETY'S LEGAL AWARENESS REMAINS INCONSISTENT AND VAGUE, WHILE LAW ABIDANCE IS STILL NOT YET HELD AS A PERSONALLY SIGNIFICANT VIRTUE OF VITAL IMPORTANCE SHARED BY MOST CITIZENS. YOUNG PEOPLE ARE READY TO SUPPORT JUSTICE, WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT MORAL VALUE FOR THEM, RATHER THAN LAW-ABIDANCE AND PROTECTING ORDER. THROUGHOUT THE LAST TEN YEARS, RUSSIAN CITIZENS' VIEWS ON THE RULE OF LAW AND ON LAW ABIDANCE HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY IMPACTED BY THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT WHICH HAS DEVELOPED LEGAL AWARENESS; AGE, EDUCATION, AND GENDER DIFFERENCES TURN OUT TO BE MUCH LESS SUBSTANTIAL FACTORS. THE EVIDENT EVER-DEVELOPING UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPORTANCE OF LAW ABIDANCE HAS NOT BEEN SUPPORTED BY AN INCREASE IN THE RUSSIAN POPULATION'S CONFIDENCE THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN GUARANTEE THE SUPREMACY OF THE LAW AND A UNIFORM LEGAL ORDER.
627	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE STATE OF CANADIAN REFUGEE LAW SINCE THE DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT IN FEBLES V CANADA (CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION) [2014] 3 SCR 431. DRAWING UPON AN ANALYSIS OF A SET OF DECISIONS OF THE IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE BOARD, THE ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL TASKED WITH REFUGEE STATUS DETERMINATION IN CANADA, THE ARTICLE SEEKS TO DETERMINE WHETHER ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION MAKERS ARE HEEDING THE GUIDANCE OF FEBLES WHEN EXCLUDING ASYLUM SEEKERS FROM REFUGEE PROTECTION ON THE BASIS OF SERIOUS CRIMINALITY PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 1F(B) OF THE 1951 CONVENTION RELATING TO THE STATUS OF REFUGEES. IN DOING SO, IT EXAMINES THE CONTROVERSY AROUND ARTICLE 1F(B) SINCE ITS INCEPTION ACROSS VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS AND AMONGST ACADEMIC COMMENTATORS, SITUATING FEBLES WITHIN THAT CONTROVERSY IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE SUPREME COURT'S RELUCTANCE TO CLEARLY SET OUT THE PURPOSE UNDERLYING ARTICLE 1F(B) IS IN STEP WITH A LONGSTANDING TENDENCY TO UNDERSTAND THE PROVISION AS SERVING A GATEKEEPING FUNCTION, THAT PREVENTS CRIMINALIZED NON-CITIZENS FROM OBTAINING MEMBERSHIP IN OUR SOCIETY. IT ARGUES THAT BY OMITTING TO SET OUT A CLEAR AND PRINCIPLED STANDARD BY WHICH ASYLUM SEEKERS CAN BE EXCLUDED FROM REFUGEE PROTECTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 1F(B), THE SUPREME COURT FAILED TO LIVE UP TO A THICK UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT CONCLUDES BY CALLING FOR A REASSERTION OF THE RULE OF LAW INTO EXCLUSION DECISION MAKING, BOTH NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGITIMACY OF THE INTERNATIONAL REFUGEE LAW REGIME IS MAINTAINED.
628	THIS RESEARCH TRIES TO FOLLOW THE EU'S ROLE AS AN AGENT OF DEMOCRATIZATION, FOLLOWING THE EFFECTS OF EUROPEANIZATION ON THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY IN THE CANDIDATE STATES. OBJECTIVE: TO IDENTIFY THE EFFECTS OF EUROPEANIZATION ON THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE. RESERCH QUESTION: 1. CAN WE TALK ABOUT POSITIVE EFFECTS OF EUROPEANISATION ON THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY IN THE CANDIDATE STATES? 2. IF THERE ARE ANY POSITIVE EFFECTS, DO THEY HAVE SHORT OR LONG TERM IMPACTS? HYPOTHESIS : DUE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE COERCION MECHANISM, EUROPEANIZATION WAS A TOP TO BOTTOM PROCESS AND LED TO A DECREASE IN THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK: A FOCUS ON THE CONCEPTS OF EUROPEANIZATION AND QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY AND THE CONCRETE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH EUROPEANISATION MAY PRODUCE EFFECTS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK: THE BINARY COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS BETWEEN ROMANIA AND POLAND ANALYSIS ITSELF: IDENTIFYING THE VULNERABLE DIMENSIONS OF THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY BEFORE THE START OF THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS WITH THE EU. CONCLUSIONS: IN THE CASE OF ROMANIA, DUE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PRESSURE TO ADAPT, EUROPEANIZATION WAS A TOP TO BOTTOM PROCESS LEADING TO: A) A DECREASE IN VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL ACCOUNTABILITY, B) AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE RULE OF LAW; IN THE CASE OF POLAND THERE WAS A DECREASE OF BOTH VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND A CONSTANT VULNERABILITY WITH REGARD THE RULE OF LAW, LEADING TO HYPOTHESIS VALIDATION.
629	(1) BACKGROUND: DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THE METHODS USED TO ENSURE THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND LIFE CHANGED. THIS STUDY USED EMPIRICAL RESEARCH METHODS TO ANALYZE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA'S LEGAL SYSTEM DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND ITS IMPACT ON THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND LIFE AND TO CLARIFY ITS IMPORTANCE IN ENSURING THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND LIFE. (2) MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS STUDY ANALYZED THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA'S RULE OF LAW SYSTEM DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC BY USING TWO AUTHORITATIVE DATABASES, THE PEKING UNIVERSITY MAGIC KEY DATABASE AND THE CHINA JUDICIAL DOCUMENTS NETWORK, AND EXAMINED THE SCOPE OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE UNDER THIS SYSTEM. (3) RESULTS: DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, CHINA'S RULE OF LAW SYSTEM, WITH THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF CONTROLLING THE PANDEMIC, DEVELOPED RAPIDLY, EFFECTIVELY ENSURING THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND LIFE IN DIFFERENT AREAS. AS PART OF THIS SYSTEM, THE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES OF GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS PLAYED A KEY ROLE. (4) CONCLUSIONS: DURING THE PERIOD OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, CHINA'S LEGAL SYSTEM PROTECTED THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND LIFE FROM THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC IN MANY AREAS. MEANWHILE, ALONG WITH THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES IN THE PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF A PANDEMIC, THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND LIFE SHOULD ALSO BE PROTECTED AGAINST ILLEGAL ADMINISTRATIVE ACTS IN THE FUTURE.
630	DO BANKS' RESPONSES TO CHANGES IN DEPOSIT INSURANCE VARY ACROSS COUNTRIES EVEN IF THE COUNTRIES HAVE COMPARABLE INSTITUTIONS? IF SO, BY HOW MUCH? USING DATA ON THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF LARGE BANKS IN 15 FINANCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, WE FIND THAT WHERE DEPOSIT INSURANCE HAS AN EFFECT, IT IS LARGE AND VARIES DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM, RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION IN THE BANK'S HOME COUNTRY. AS IN PRIOR PAPERS, WE SHOW THAT DURING STABLE ECONOMIC PERIODS, INCREASES IN DEPOSIT INSURANCE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER BANK RISK, BOTH PROBLEM LOANS AND LEVERAGE. IN MOST, BUT NOT ALL, CASES STRONGER INSTITUTIONS TEMPER THESE EFFECTS. THE INSTITUTIONS' EFFECTS ARE SUBSTANTIAL. FOR EXAMPLE, AVERAGE CHANGES IN THE RULE OF LAW DOUBLE THE IMPACT OF A CHANGE IN DEPOSIT INSURANCE ON BANK LEVERAGE. WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUBSTANTIAL LITERATURE IN THIS AREA BY SHOWING THAT THE INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTS ARE SIGNIFICANT EVEN ACROSS A SET OF COUNTRIES WITH COMPARABLE INSTITUTIONS; BY CONDUCTING A CAREFUL CALIBRATION OF THE ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EFFECTS; BY PROVIDING EVIDENCE THAT DURING STABLE PERIODS CHANGES IN DEPOSIT INSURANCE ONLY AFFECT BANK RISK AND NOT OTHER MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE; AND FINALLY BY SHOWING THAT THE EFFECTS OF BOTH DEPOSIT INSURANCE AND INSTITUTIONS VARY ACROSS STABLE AND CRISIS ECONOMIC PERIODS. THE STABLE PERIOD RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MORAL HAZARD EFFECTS OF DEPOSIT INSURANCE, WHILE THE CRISIS PERIOD RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH ENDOGENEITY CONCERNS THAT POOR BANK PERFORMANCE COULD DRIVE CHANGES IN REGULATIONS.
631	THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE MAIN DETERMINANTS AND OUTCOMES OF HONDURAN DEMOCRACY. THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY IN HONDURAS CAN BE ANALYZED AND STUDIED THROUGH EIGHT DIMENSIONS BASED ON LEONARDO MORLINO'S THOUGHT. THIS ANALYTICAL MODEL INCLUDES: POLITICAL PARTICIPATION, POLITICAL COMPETITION, ELECTORAL ACCOUNTABILITY, INTER-INSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY, RULE OF LAW, RESPONSIVENESS, LIBERTY, AND SOLIDARITY. THE PAPER TAKES IN CONSIDERATION THE PREVIOUS RESEARCH OF BOTH AUTHORS ON THE SUBJECT. SO, THE MANUSCRIPT DISCUSS THE MAJOR LIMITATIONS OF THE POLITICAL EVOLUTION AND THE POLICIES NEEDED TO IMPROVE THE DEMOCRATIC QUALITY OF HONDURAS.
632	THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE ROLE OF THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE IN APPLYING THE COMPLEMENTARITY PRINCIPLE THROUGH ITS PRELIMINARY EXAMINATIONS DURING THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT. IT UNDERLIES THE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT THE ICC HAS STARTED PLAYING WITHIN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THE NEED FOR A DIFFERENT STRATEGY FOR EACH OF THE SITUATIONS UNDER ANALYSIS BY THE ICC OFFICE OF THE PROSECUTOR, AND THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE OF THE PRELIMINARY EXAMINATIONS TO STRENGTHEN NATIONAL COURTS AND RULE OF LAW IN THE STATES CONCERNED.
633	THE RAPID, SIMULTANEOUS CONSTRUCTION OF MARKETS, DEMOCRATIC REGIMES, RULE OF LAW, AND CIVIL SOCIETIES IS IMPOSSIBLE IN MOST SOVIET SUCCESSOR STATES. THE USSR'S COLLAPSE FAILED TO GENERATE TWO NECESSARY CONDITIONS OF SUCH REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE: A REVOLUTIONARY ELITE AND THE CAPACITY TO PURSUE REVOLUTIONARY POLICIES. UKRAINE AND RUSSIA ARE PARADIGMATIC EXAMPLES OF THE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED PATHS THAT THE USSR'S SUCCESSOR STATES CAN FOLLOW. THE STRUCTURAL LEGACY OF THE SOVIET COLLAPSE PERMITTED UKRAINE TO SUCCEED AT UNSPECTACULAR EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE BUT CONDEMNED RUSSIAN TO SPECTACULAR REVOLUTIONARY FAILURE.
634	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO IDENTIFY AND TEST THE DETERMINATES OF EARNINGS OPACITY INTERNATIONALLY. THE DETERMINATES ARE HYPOTHESIZED TO BE THE ELEMENTS OF SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND ACCOUNTING ORDER IN EACH OF THE 34 COUNTRIES OF THE STUDY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - A SAMPLE OF 34 COUNTRIES' DATA WAS COLLECTED AND DATA ESTIMATION AND SEVERAL STATISTICAL AND CORRELATIONS WERE PERFORMED. FINDINGS - EARNINGS OPACITY INTERNATIONALLY IS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO THE LEVELS OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND QUALITY OF LIFE, AND POSITIVELY RELATED TO RULE OF LAW, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND LEVEL OF CORRUPTION. FURTHER, THE FINDINGS ARE SURPRISING THAT THE LEVEL OF DISCLOSURE, THE NUMBER OF AUDITORS PER 100,000 INHABITANTS AND THE ADOPTION OF INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (AS ELEMENTS OF THE ACCOUNTING ORDER) ARE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO EARNINGS OPACITY INTERNATIONALLY. IT IS THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CLIMATE RATHER THAN THE TECHNICAL ACCOUNTING CLIMATE THAT IS AT THE CORE OF THE LACK OF ACCOUNTING QUALITY IN GENERAL AND EARNINGS OPACITY IN PARTICULAR. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - ELEMENTS OF ACCOUNTING ORDER DO NOT SEEM TO AFFECT EARNINGS OPACITY AS MUCH AS SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS. IT IS THE ECONOMIC AND THE SOCIAL CONTEXT RATHER THAN THE TECHNICAL THAT EXPLICATES BETTER THE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTING QUALITY IN GENERAL AND THE LEVEL OF EARNINGS OPACITY IN PARTICULAR IN A GIVEN COUNTRY. EARNINGS OPACITY IS HIGHER AS A RESULT OF HIGHER RULE OF LAW, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND LEVEL OF CORRUPTION, AND LOWER AS RESULT OF HIGHER LEVEL OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND QUALITY OF LIFE.
635	THEORY: WE USE COMPETING PROPOSITIONS FROM THE LITERATURE ON INSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY AND COMPLIANCE TO TRACE THE SOURCES OF ACCEPTANCE OF, OR THE PROPENSITY TO COMPLY WITH, JUDICIAL DECISIONS. HYPOTHESES: GENERALLY, INSTITUTIONS WITH A STORE OF LEGITIMACY ARE MORE SUCCESSFUL AT EVOKING ACQUIESCENCE TO THEIR DECISIONS. WE EXPECT WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT AN UNPOPULAR DECISION TO BE MOST PREVALENT AMONG THOSE WHO ARE STRONGLY COMMITTED TO THE INSTITUTION ITSELF, WHO PERCEIVE THE COURT AS USING FAIR PROCEDURES TO MAKE ITS DECISIONS, WHO ARE STRONGLY ATTACHED TO THE RULE OF LAW, AND WHO ARE NEUTRAL ABOUT THE ISSUE ON WHICH THE COURT HAS MADE A DECISION. METHODS: REGRESSION ANALYSIS OF ITEMS FROM A SURVEY OF THE MASS PUBLICS IN THE TWELVE MEMBER-STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IN FALL 1992. RESULTS: THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE DOES NOT HAVE AN EXTENSIVE STORE OF GOOD WILL AMONG ORDINARY CITIZENS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. FEW PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT A COURT OF JUSTICE DECISION THEY FIND OBJECTIONABLE. THERE IS, HOWEVER, A MODERATELY STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEGITIMACY-I.E., DIFFUSE SUPPORT-AND ACCEPTANCE. PERCEPTIONS OF PROCEDURAL JUSTICE PLAY LITTLE ROLE IN THE PROCESS, ALTHOUGH BASIC LEGAL VALUES (E.G., ATTITUDES TOWARD THE RULE OF LAW) CONTRIBUTE TO ACCEPTANCE WITHIN SOME COUNTRIES. IN GENERAL, OUR RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT LEGITIMACY IS IMPORTANT FOR ACCEPTANCE AND PROBABLY FOR COMPLIANCE; AND THAT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE MUST TEND TO WHAT MAY BE AN EMERGING SHORTFALL OF LEGITIMACY FOR THE HIGH BENCH OF THE EUROPEAN UNION.
636	HOW DID THE CATHOLIC BISHOPS IN GERMANY REACT TO THE EVENTS SURROUNDING JUNE 17TH, 1953? THE "NEW COURSE" THAT HAD BEEN DECREED BY THE LEADERS IN MOSCOW HAD PUT AN END TO THE SED LEADERSHIP'S BATTLE AGAINST THE CHURCH, AND IT HAD LED TO AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PROTESTANT CHURCH AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE GDR. AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE BISHOPS OF THE CATHOLIC DIASPORA CHURCH IN THE GDR ACCEPTED GROTEWOHL'S OFFER TO HAVE TALKS, AND THEY REACHED SOME PARTIAL ALLEVIATIONS IN GDR PARISH LIFE. THE POPULAR UPRISING ON 16TH AND 17TH JUNE 1953 DID NOT QUESTION THE LOYALTY TO THE STATE WHICH THE LEADERS OF THE CHURCH IN THE GDR HAD TRADITIONALLY SHOWN, BUT THEY CONNECTED THIS LOYALTY WITH THE RESTORATION OF THE RULE OF LAW, ABOVE ALL IN MATTERS CONCERNING CHURCH AND RELIGION. IN THIS CONTEXT THE NATIONAL REUNIFICATION PLAYED A COMPARATIVELY SECONDARY ROLE. AT THE SAME TIME BISHOPS IN WEST GERMANY CAMPAIGNED FOR DONATIONS TO MEET THE MATERIAL NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE IN THE GDR. THE SELF-ASSERTION OF THE CHURCH, THE FUNDAMENTAL PROTEST AGAINST THE BREACH OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE SUPPORT OF THOSE IN NEED CORRESPONDED WITH THE WAY THE BISHOPS DEFINED THEMSELVES. WITH THE ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE BEING LIMITED BY THE POLITICAL STRUCTURES, THERE WERE NO REAL ALTERNATIVES FOR THE LEADERS OF THE CATHOLIC DIASPORA CHURCH AT THE MARGIN OF THE POPULAR REVOLT.
637	FINANCIAL STABILITY AND GUARANTEE CONTINUE TO REMAIN OF GREAT INTEREST TO EVERY SOCIETY, IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH STABILITY, THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM OF A COUNTRY WILL CONTINUE TO BE THREATENED. THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO ANALYZE THE LEGAL GUARANTEES OF THE PROCESSES FOR PROVIDING FINANCIAL SERVICES IN UKRAINE, TO IDENTIFY PROBLEMATIC ASPECTS IN THIS AREA AND TO FORM POSSIBLE WAYS TO OVERCOME THEM. THE QUALITY OF LEGAL GUARANTEES OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKET DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, IN PARTICULAR, THE POLITICAL REGIME OF THE STATE, THE EXISTENCE OF REAL RULE OF LAW, THE LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT OF FINANCIAL AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS, ETC. IT HAS BEEN ARGUED THAT THE FINANCIAL SECTOR OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY IS UNABLE TO FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY WITHOUT PROPER LEGAL REGULATION, WHOSE QUALITY CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED IN TERMS OF A STABLE AND SMOOTH POLITICAL REGIME. GIVEN THE SITUATION IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, AS WELL AS CONSIDERING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, IT HAS BEEN FOUND OUT THAT EFFECTIVE LEGAL REGULATION OF FINANCIAL SERVICES IS MOSTLY AVAILABLE IN DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES, WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS ACTUALLY REALIZED. IT HAS BEEN CONCLUDED THAT AN EFFECTIVE LEGAL GUARANTEEING FOR THE PROVISION OF FINANCIAL SERVICES CAN IMPROVE THE DOMESTIC FINANCIAL MARKET, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND THE NATIONAL ECONOMY WILL FACILITATE TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LEGAL GUARANTEEING IN THIS AREA. THE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE OF DEVELOPED DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT ASSISTANCE IN ACHIEVING THIS.
638	THIS ARTICLE DELINEATES THE NEGOTIATED SPACE OF CIVIL AUTONOMY IN POST-HANDOVER HONG KONG THROUGH THE CONTINGENT INTERPLAY OF LAW, DISCOURSE, DRAMATURGY AND POLITICS. IT TAKES THE PUBLIC ORDER ORDINANCE DISPUTE IN 2000 AS THE FIRST MAJOR TEST CASE OF CIVIL CONFLICTS IN THE SHADOW OF THE RIGHT OF ABODE STRUGGLE. AS IT UNFOLDED, THE EVENT DEMONSTRATED BOTH THE POWER AND LIMITS OF RESISTANCE BY THE PEOPLE, AND THE GOVERNMENT'S INCREASING WILL, AS WELL AS THE STRATEGIES IT USED, TO RULE WITHIN THE "LAW AND ORDER" FRAMEWORK UNDER CONTINUAL CHALLENGES. IN THE EVENT, CIVIL AUTONOMY HAD BEEN A CONTESTED ISSUE INVOLVING CONSIDERATIONS OF RULE OF LAW, RIGHTS, CIVIC PROPRIETY, STATE LEGITIMACY AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF PARTICULAR IDENTITY (SUCH AS STUDENT-HOOD). GIVEN THE MULTIPLICITY OF DISCOURSES AND SUB-DISCOURSES, CITIZENSHIP PRACTICES AND PUBLIC CRITICISMS OPENED UP A CONTESTED SPACE FOR RESISTANCE AND NEGOTIATION. A CAMPAIGN OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE WAS AT FIRST SUCCESSFULLY MOUNTED THROUGH AN ENSEMBLE OF POLITICAL AND SYMBOLIC MECHANISMS. A TURNING POINT WAS CONFIGURED WHEN, MEDIATED BY A MEANING RECONSTRUCTION PROCESS, THE GOVERNMENT MADE A SERIES OF POLITICAL AND PERFORMATIVE ACTS TO RE-SCRIPT THE DRAMA, WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE AN IRONIC SUCCESS FOR ITSELF THAT PUT STATE-SOCIETY RELATIONS ON AN INCREASINGLY TENUOUS COURSE. ULTIMATELY IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES WERE AT STAKE: RESPECT FOR A RIGHTS-BASED DISCOURSE OF RULE OF LAW VERSUS THE ASSERTION OF POLITICAL AND LEGAL AUTHORITARIANISM.
639	AGENDA 2030 ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PROMOTES A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO DEVELOPMENT AND EMPHASIZES THE NEED TO LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND. REGARDING THE RULE OF LAW, SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL (SDG) 16.3 FOCUSES ON (PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW AT THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS AND ENSURE EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR ALL BY 2030) AND THE RELATED GOALS AND TARGETS ON JUSTICE. CHANGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN RECENT DECADES HAVE CAUSED STAGNATING WAGES AND WIDENING ECONOMIC GAPS AMONG INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS AND REGIONS WITHIN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN POCKETS OF POVERTY AND INEQUALITY IN HIGH INCOME COUNTRIES AND ISLANDS OF EXCESS WEALTH IN DEVELOPING OR LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES, WORSENED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE LEGAL ASPECTS OF POVERTY AND INEQUALITY IN THE EDUCATION AND HEALTH SECTORS IN SELECT HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA AND A WESTERN INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRY SUCH AS THE UK, WITH EMPHASIS ON PERIOD POVERTY OR POOR MENSTRUAL HEALTH MANAGEMENT (MHM) AS A BARRIER TO ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND HEALTH DUE TO INABILITY TO AFFORD SANITARY PRODUCTS. THE ANALYTICAL PAPER APPLIES THE INSTITUTIONALIST LEGISLATIVE THEORY AND METHODOLOGY (ILTAM) AND THE GENERAL THEORY OF LAW AND DEVELOPMENT, EXAMINES THE ROLE OF THE STATE IN REGULATING THE HEALTH AND EDUCATION SECTORS AND CONCLUDES WITH KEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW THE INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORKS CAN BE UTILIZED TO FOSTER SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.
640	PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF NATURAL RESOURCES, MARKET SIZE AND FIVE MAJOR INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS (VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY; POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE; REGULATORY QUALITY; RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION) ON CHINESE FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) IN AFRICA. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS STUDY USES REGRESSION ANALYSIS ON PANEL DATA ACROSS 22 COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 2008-2014. FINDINGS NATURAL RESOURCES DID NOT PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN ATTRACTING CHINESE INVESTMENTS, BUT MARKET SIZE DID. AMONG THE INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS, ONLY VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY HAD A SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE EFFECT ON ATTRACTING CHINESE FDI; THE EFFECTS OF RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT AND POLITICAL STABILITY AND REGULATORY QUALITY HAD A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE EFFECT. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS CHINESE INVESTMENT IN AFRICA IS ONLY A RECENT PHENOMENON, AND IS GROWING RAPIDLY; FURTHER STUDIES SHOULD EXAMINE FACTORS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THE CONTEXT SUCH AS BILATERAL POLITICAL LINK. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS AFRICAN COUNTRIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH IMPROVING THEIR POOR INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN THE SHORT TERM COULD EFFECTIVELY ATTRACT CHINESE INVESTMENT BY REDUCING INVESTOR PSYCHIC DISTANCE, E.G. ESTABLISHING A CLOSER POLITICAL LINK WITH CHINA. NEVERTHELESS, IN THE LONG TERM, MEASURES OF IMPROVING INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ARE IMPORTANT. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS STUDY REVEALS FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT WHAT ATTRACTS CHINESE INVESTMENT IS MARKET SIZE RATHER THAN NATURAL RESOURCES, AND DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS OF AN AFRICAN COUNTRY SHOW VARYING EFFECTS ON ATTRACTING CHINESE FDI.
641	FOR NEARLY THREE DECADES, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT HAS STRUGGLED WITH THE PROPER TREATMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION THAT DEPARTS FROM AGENCY PRECEDENT. MOVING TOWARD A STRONGER THEORETICAL ACCOUNT OF ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGE REQUIRES EXPLORING AN UNDERAPPRECIATED FEATURE OF ALL ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION: THE AGENCY'S CHOSEN MODE OF REASONING. AGENCIES SOMETIMES EXECUTE THEIR REGULATORY MANDATES BY WEIGHING EVIDENCE, UTILIZING TECHNICAL EXPERTISE, AND MAKING VALUE JUDGMENTS IN A PROCESS REFLECTING WHAT WE REFER TO AS PRESCRIPTIVE REASONING. AT OTHER TIMES, AGENCIES EMPLOY A MORE EXPOSITORY FORM OF REASONING GROUNDED IN ANALYSIS OF CONGRESSIONAL INTENT OR THE CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY RELEVANT JUDICIAL OPINIONS. WHILE PRESCRIPTIVE REASONING YIELDS CONCLUSIONS ABOUT OPTIMAL AND RESPONSIVE POLICY, EXPOSITORY REASONING EXHIBITS A DRIVING CONCERN WITH WHAT THE LAW IS. THAT DISTINCTION, COMBINED WITH MODERN ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES' POWERS TO RENDER OFFICIAL PRONOUNCEMENTS ABOUT THE MEANING OF LEGAL TEXTS, ACTIVATES FUNDAMENTAL RULE-OF-LAW INTERESTS THAT SHOULD LIMIT AN AGENCY'S DISCRETION TO DEVIATE FROM PRECEDENT BY INVOKING EXPOSITORY ARGUMENTS-IN OTHER WORDS, BY DECLARING THAT A LEGAL PRONOUNCEMENT WHICH MEANT X YESTERDAY MEANS Y TODAY. THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A NEW THEORY AND DOCTRINE OF ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGE THAT AFFORDS SUBSTANTIAL DEFERENCE WHERE CHANGE IS DRIVEN BY PRESCRIPTIVE REASONING, BUT REQUIRES DE NOVO SCRUTINY OF REVERSALS GROUNDED IN EXPOSITORY REASONING. THE PROPOSAL STRIKES AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN THE NEED FOR AGENCY FLEXIBILITY AND THE PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE OF A STALWART, VIBRANT RULE OF LAW.
642	THE SOURCE OF LAW, THE CASE-LAW OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (HEREINAFTER - THE ECTHR), IS PLAYING AN INCREASINGLY SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE PRACTICE OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS IN UKRAINE. THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ECTHR SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN UKRAINE IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. THEREFORE, THE PHENOMENON OF JUDICIAL PRECEDENT AND THE APPLICATION OF ECTHR PRACTICE IN CRIMINAL LAW REQUIRES COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS. THE WORK AIMS TO STUDY THE CASE LAW AND PRACTICE OF THE ECHR IN CRIMINAL LAW, PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE OF APPLICATION OF COURT PRECEDENTS BY NATIONAL COURTS, AND WAYS TO SOLVE THEM. THE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY CONSISTS OF SUCH METHODS AS HISTORICAL AND LEGAL; COMPARATIVE LAW; FORMAL AND LOGICAL; EMPIRICAL; COGNITIVE; METHOD OF ANALOGY; SYNTHESIS METHOD; METHOD OF ANALYSIS. THE VALUE OF ECTHR DECISIONS IS THAT SUCH DECISIONS, MORE QUICKLY THAN OTHER CRIMINAL PROCEDURAL MEANS, MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PROCESS OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES, THUS IMPROVING THE MECHANISM OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURAL REGULATION TO GUARANTEE CONVENTIONAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS. IN ADDITION, THE RECOGNITION OF THE CASE LAW OF THE ECTHR AS A SOURCE OF LAW IS NECESSARY FOR THE ADAPTATION OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION OF UKRAINE TO THE LEGISLATION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. ALTHOUGH LEGAL PRECEDENT IS NOT OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED AS A SOURCE OF LAW IN UKRAINE, THE DECISION OF THE ECTHR RECOGNIZING CASE LAW CAN BE CONSIDERED IN UKRAINE AS A RULE OF LAW.
643	THE ARTICLE OFFERS AN ANALYSIS OF THE IDEAS OF THE LIBERAL AND MODERATE RIGHT-WING LEADERS OF THE PROGRESSIVE BLOC IN THE FOURTH STATE DUMA FOR HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL ORIGINS OF THE FEBRUARY REVOLUTION OF 1917, WHICH HAVE CAUSED A CRISIS OF RUSSIAN STATEHOOD. THE DIVERSITY OF HISTORIANS' OPINIONS OF THE CAUSES OF THE REVOLUTIONARY CRISIS OF THE TIME STIPULATES THE CONTINUATION OF THE DISCUSSION ON THIS TOPIC. IT IS IMPORTANT TO ANALYZE THE POLITICAL CULTURE OF INDIVIDUALS WHO PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN RESOLVING THE ISSUE OF POWER AT THE TIME, WHEN THEY IDENTIFIED THEIR POLITICAL PRIORITIES AND DECISION-MAKING MOTIVATION. THE IDEAS OF THE PROGRESSISTS ABOUT LONG-TERM PROCESSES WITH A REVOLUTIONARY POTENTIAL WERE RECONSTRUCTED: THE INCOMPLETENESS OF REFORMS, THE MONARCHY'S ORIENTATION TOWARD POLITICAL TRADITIONS, THE ABSENCE OF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE AUTHORITIES AND THE LIBERALS, THE RADICALISM OF THE LEFTIST FORCES IN THE COUNTRY, THE SOCIOCULTURAL SPLIT IN SOCIETY, THE INABILITY OF THE AUTHORITIES TO INTRODUCE THE RULE OF LAW, AND OTHERS. THE IDEOLOGICAL-VALUE ELEMENTS IN AN INTERPRETATION OF THE SOCIO-POLITICAL PROCESSES HAVING LED TO THE FEBRUARY REVOLUTION BY LIBERALS AND MODERATE RIGHT-WING ACTIVISTS ARE SHOWN: THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY, POLITICAL FREEDOMS AND HUMAN RIGHTS, CULTURE, POWERFUL STATEHOOD, RUSSIA. THE VALUE APPROACH HAS DETERMINED THE VISION BY THE INTELLECTUAL POLITICIANS OF THE NATIONAL PRIORITIES OF RUSSIA'S DEVELOPMENT - THE INTERACTION OF THE GOVERNMENT WITH THE PUBLIC ON THE CONDITION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS PROTECTION.
644	THE BELT AND ROAD COUNTRIES ARE MOSTLY EMERGING AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND HEADING TO ATTAIN ECONOMIC PROSPERITY; HOWEVER, THIS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS LEADS TO ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT. THE FACTORS OF ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT NEED TO BE IDENTIFIED AND SOUND LEVEL OF QUALITY INSTITUTIONS MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO OVERCOME THE ISSUE OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION. UTILIZING DATA FROM 1985 TO 2019 OF THE BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE (BRI) COUNTRIES, THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY INDICATORS AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT ON CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSION BY INCLUDING ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH TO THE MODEL. BY USING OLS, FIXED EFFECT, AND TWO-STEP GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS, THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION INCREASE CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSION AND DEGRADE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. THREE OUT OF SIX INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY INDICATORS THAT INCLUDE GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AND CORRUPTION CONTROL EFFECT CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSION POSITIVELY, WHILE THE OTHER THREE THAT INCLUDE RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND POLITICAL STABILITY SIGNIFICANTLY RISE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. THE INTERACTION TERMS OF VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND POLITICAL STABILITY WITH FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT ALSO GIVE NEGATIVE COEFFICIENTS AND REDUCE EMISSION; HOWEVER, THE INTERACTION OF CONTROL OF CORRUPTION WITH FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT IS POSITIVE AND THE INTERACTION OF RULE OF LAW AND REGULATORY QUALITY WITH CARBON DIOXIDE IS INSIGNIFICANT. THE FINDINGS HAVE CONSIDERABLE POLICY IMPLICATION FOR THE SAMPLE COUNTRIES ON EACH INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY INDICATOR AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN RISING ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY.
645	ALL MODELS OF LEGAL GOVERNANCE AND MOST REGULATORY OPTIONS HAVE TO DO WITH 'TOP-DOWN' SOLUTIONS AS AN ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT OF THE APPROACH. SUCH MODELS MAY INCLUDE 'BOTTOM-UP' FORMS OF SELF-REGULATION, SUCH AS IN FORMS OF EX POST REGULATION, OR UNENFORCED SELF-REGULATION. THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON WHAT LIES IN BETWEEN SUCH TOP-DOWN AND BOTTOM-UP APPROACHES, NAMELY, THE MIDDLE-OUT INTERFACE OF THE ANALYSIS. WITHIN THE EU LEGAL FRAMEWORK, THIS MIDDLE-OUT LAYER IS MAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH FORMS OF CO-REGULATION, AS DEFINED BY RECITAL 44 OF THE 2010 AVMS DIRECTIVE AND ARTICLE 5(2) OF THE GDPR. HOWEVER, THERE ARE ALSO ADDITIONAL MODELS ON HOW WE SHOULD GRASP THE MIDDLE-OUT LAYER OF LEGAL REGULATION, AS SHOWN BY THE DEBATES ON THE GOVERNANCE OF AI AND THE WEB OF DATA. FOR EXAMPLE, THE DEBATES ON ISSUES SUCH AS MONITORED SELF-REGULATION, COORDINATION MECHANISMS FOR GOOD AI GOVERNANCE, AND 'WIND-ROSE' MODELS FOR THE WEB OF DATA MAKE IT CLEAR THAT CO-REGULATION IS NOT THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO BOTH BOTTOM-UP AND TOP-DOWN APPROACHES. FROM A METHODOLOGICAL VIEWPOINT, THE MIDDLE-OUT APPROACH SHEDS LIGHT ON THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ISSUES THAT REGARD (I) HOW TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN MULTIPLE REGULATORY SYSTEMS; (II) HOW TO ALIGN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY RULES OF THE LAW; AND (III) HOW TO PROPERLY COORDINATE BOTTOM-UP AND TOP-DOWN POLICY CHOICES. THE INCREASING COMPLEXITY OF TECHNOLOGICAL REGULATION RECOMMENDS NEW MODELS OF GOVERNANCE THAT REVOLVE AROUND THIS MIDDLE-OUT ANALYTICAL GROUND.
646	THIS PAPER IS ABOUT LEGISLATIVE DEFINITIONS AND DRAFTING. I WILL EXPLORE IF AND HOW A THOUGHTFULLY DRAFTED LEGISLATIVE DEFINITION OF A BROAD CONCEPT IN THE LAW, AS WELL AS THE DEFINING PROCESS ITSELF, MAY BE TOOLS FOR INCREASING ACCESS TO JUSTICE, SPECIFICALLY IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW CONTEXT. GIVEN THAT ACCESS TO JUSTICE STRENGTHENS THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE SYSTEM (THROUGH TRANSPARENCY, PREDICTABILITY, THE USE OF PLAIN LANGUAGE, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF MEANINGFUL DUE PROCESS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS), ITS BETTERMENT WILL REINFORCE THE RULE OF LAW. WHILE THIS PAPER BEGINS BY DISCUSSING FAR-REACHING PROCESSES AND BIG CONCEPTS, I NARROW MY ANALYSIS TO FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON SECTION 12 OF THE YUKON HUMAN RIGHTS ACT, WHICH CONCERNS SYSTEMIC DISCRIMINATION AND ITS OPERABILITY IN THE YUKON TERRITORY. I DISCUSS WHETHER AND HOW RE-DRAFTING THIS PROVISION MAY OCCUR THROUGH AN EXPANDED CAPABILITIES APPROACH, INSPIRED BY AMARTYA SEN, AND COMPLEMENTED BY THE THEORETICAL IDEAS OF STANDPOINT THEORY AND LEGAL EMPOWERMENT. THE YUKON CASE STUDY'S TEACHINGS AND PROVOCATIONS MAY APPLY TO OTHER SITUATIONS WITHIN CANADIAN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AND BEYOND. ALTHOUGH THERE IS LITERATURE ON THE PLACE OF LEGISLATIVE DRAFTING WITHIN THE WIDER WESTERN LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC FRAMEWORK, AS WELL AS SOME SEPARATE, LIMITED COMMENTARY ON THE INTERSECTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE, MY PIECE IS UNIQUE IN THAT IT COMBINES LEGISLATIVE DRAFTING IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE CONTEXT WITH CONSIDERATIONS OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW IN A NOVEL WAY.
647	BACKGROUND: ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES FOR THE RULE OF LAW IS JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS BECAUSE JUSTICE IS A RIGHT AND SHOULD NOT BE ACTTED AGAINST IT; JUSTICE IS CLOSELY LINKED TO THE CONCEPT OF RESPECT FOR RIGHTS. IN FACT, JUSTICE IS LAW-ABIDING BEHAVIOR, SO INJUSTICE IS ANTI-LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. IN FACT, FAIR TRIAL IS A PERSONAL TRIAL IN THE LIGHT OF THE LAW WITH RESPECT FOR CITIZENSHIP AND A GROUND FOR PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW. THIS RIGHT IS SYSTEMATICALLY REGULATED BY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL NORMS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SOME PRINCIPLES. COURTS ARE FORMED TO ENSURE JUSTICE AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION, SO THEY MUST BE SENSITIVE IN THEIR ACTIONS AND THE FOUNDATION OF THEIR FORMATION. COURTS HAVE THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN ACHIEVING THE GOALS OF THE JUDICIARY, AND IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS IN ADVANCE THEY MUST ADHERE TO CERTAIN PRINCIPLES THAT GUARANTEE THE CORRECTNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND THE FAIRNESS OF DECISIONS. FOLLOWING THESE PRINCIPLES AND CRITERIA, THE DEVELOPMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN ANY SOCIETY WILL BE CLOSELY LINKED TO THE FAIR TRIAL IN THAT SOCIETY THAT REQUIRES THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF THE ACTORS IN THE CRIMINAL PROCESS. CONCLUSION: PROMOTING CRIMINAL JUSTICE ALSO PROMOTES PUBLIC DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNITY EXCELLENCE. BECAUSE WHEN CITIZENS SEE THAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE RESPECTED AND SUPPORTED BY THE GOVERNMENT BOARD, THEY FEEL A SENSE OF JUDICIAL SECURITY AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR COMMUNITY.
648	THE PAPER INVESTIGATES THE DETERMINANTS OF TAXES COLLECTED NET OF PUBLIC SERVICES FOR A SAMPLE OF 104 COUNTRIES FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD OVER 1996-2016 PERIOD. STARTING FROM THE ASSUMPTION THAT WHAT REALLY MATTERS FOR THE TAXPAYER IS THE TAX MONEY THAT ACTUALLY RETURN TO THE SOCIETY, AFTER PAYING THE COST OF GOVERNMENT, WE INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT OF TAXES COLLECTED NET OF PUBLIC SERVICES AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TAXES TO GDP RATIO AND GENERAL PUBLIC SERVICES EXPENDITURES TO THE GDP RATIO AND INVESTIGATES ITS DETERMINANTS FROM GOVERNANCE PERSPECTIVE. THE MAIN DETERMINANTS LOOKED UPON WERE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (WGI): CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, TAKEN FROM WORLD BANK SURVEYS. AS CONTROL VARIABLE WE USED GDP PER CAPITA ANNUAL GROWTH RATE. WE INCLUDE YEAR FIXED EFFECTS IN ORDER TO CONTROL FOR GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS, AND ALSO COUNTRY FIXED EFFECTS TO CONTROL FOR UNOBSERVABLE COUNTRY-LEVEL FACTORS THAT ARE CONSTANT OVER THE SAMPLE PERIOD. THE ANALYSIS FOLLOWS THE WORLD BANK COUNTRY CLASSIFICATION ON LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT: LOW INCOME, LOWER MIDDLE-, HIGHER MIDDLE INCOME AND HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE RULE OF LAW GOVERNANCE CHARACTERISTIC AFFECTED THE TAXES NET OF PUBLIC SERVICES THE MOST, BOTH IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC EFFECT AND OF COUNTRIES COVERAGE, WHILE THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND REGULATORY QUALITY WERE FOUND SIGNIFICANT ONLY FOR LOWER-MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES AND LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES RESPECTIVELY. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS WERE MADE ACCORDINGLY.
649	THIS PAPER IS ASSESSING THE LEGALITY OF BORDER CLOSURES DECIDED BY A VAST NUMBER OF COUNTRIES WITH THE VIEW OF LIMITING THE SPREAD OF COVID-19. ALTHOUGH THIS ISSUE HAS RAISED DIVERGING INTERPRETATIONS IN RELATION TO INTERNATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS AND REGIONAL FREE MOVEMENT AGREEMENTS, INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW PROVIDES A CLEAR-CUT ANSWER: THE RULE OF LAW STOPS NEITHER AT THE BORDER NOR IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY. AGAINST THIS NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK, BORDER CONTROL CAN AND MUST BE CARRIED OUT WITH THE TWOFOLD PURPOSE OF PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, WHEREAS BORDER CLOSURE IS UNABLE TO DO SO BECAUSE IT IS BY ESSENCE A COLLECTIVE AND AUTOMATIC DENIAL OF ADMISSION WITHOUT ANY OTHER FORM OF PROCESS. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT BLANKET ENTRY BANS ON THE GROUND OF PUBLIC HEALTH ARE ILLEGAL UNDER INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW. THEY CANNOT BE RECONCILED WITH THE MOST BASIC RIGHTS OF MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES, INCLUDING THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-REFOULEMENT AND ACCESS TO ASYLUM PROCEDURES, THE PROHIBITION OF COLLECTIVE EXPULSION, THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD AND THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-DISCRIMINATION. THE PAPER CONCLUDES ON THE WAYS TO BETTER INTEGRATE AT THE BORDERS PUBLIC HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS IMPERATIVES IN DUE RESPECT WITH THE RULE OF LAW. IN BOTH LAW AND PRACTICE, PUBLIC HEALTH AND MIGRANT'S RIGHTS ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. THEY CAN REINFORCE EACH OTHER WITHIN A COMPREHENSIVE HUMAN RIGHTS BASED APPROACH TO HEALTH AND MIGRATION POLICIES.
650	PURPOSE - ALTHOUGH OUTSOURCING HAS EMERGED AS A KEY BUSINESS PRACTICE IN GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT IT HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ADOPTED. SINCE THE REASONS FOR OUTSOURCING SUCCESS AND FAILURE ARE UNDEREXPLORED THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF CONTRACTUAL COMPLETENESS AND COMPLEMENTARY ENFORCEMENT PRACTICES SUCH AS COOPERATION AND MONITORING AND SANCTIONING PRACTICES UNDER VARYING RISK SCENARIOS. CRITICALLY, THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE EXAMINED IN THE CONTEXT OF TWO SERIOUS RISKS: LEGAL RISK IN THE GUISE OF RULE OF LAW AND SUPPLIER NON-CONFORMANCE RISK. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - CROSS-COUNTY, SURVEY DATA WAS COLLECTED THROUGH THE GLOBAL MANUFACTURING RESEARCH GROUP AND COMBINED WITH SECONDARY DATA FROM THE WORLD BANK. THE AUTHORS CARRIED OUT A SERIES OF REGRESSION ANALYSIS TO EXPLORE THEIR RESEARCH QUESTIONS. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT RISK IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF OUTSOURCING SUCCESS WITH LEGAL RISK REDUCING OUTSOURCING PERFORMANCE ON BOTH COST AND QUALITY AND SUPPLIER RISK REDUCING OUTSOURCING PERFORMANCE ON QUALITY. THE RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THAT THESE OUTCOMES CAN BE MITIGATED IN SOME SETTINGS VIA COMPLETE CONTRACTS AND COMPLEMENTARY PRACTICES. THESE FINDINGS ARE LIKELY TO BE GENERALIZED THROUGHOUT THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND ARE OF RELEVANCE BEYOND THE DYAD. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - IN THE REALM OF SUPPLY CHAIN PRACTICES THIS STUDY PRESENTS A COMPREHENSIVE ATTEMPT TO ASSESS THE IMPORTANCE OF RISK AND COMPLEMENTARY PRACTICES FOR THE SUCCESS OF OUTSOURCING CONTRACTS. FURTHERMORE, IT ASSESSES THE ROLE OF CONTEXTUAL FACTORS SUCH AS RISK AND THE RULE OF LAW.
651	OBJECTIVE: THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE THAT LAW FIRMS PLAYED IN THE PRESENTATION OF ANNULMENT APPEALS THAT HAD THE PURPOSE OF ANNULLING THE RESULTS OF THE SECOND NATIONAL ELECTORAL ROUND PROMOTED BY THE FUERZA POPULAR POLITICAL PARTY. FROM A THEORETICAL ASPECT, AN ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN SOCIO-LEGAL AND INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH ON THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND THE MAIN THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS THAT JUSTIFY ITS STUDY AND IMPACT IN THE LEGAL FIELD IS CARRIED OUT, HIGHLIGHTING ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY IN CONTEXTS OF POLITICAL POLARIZATION. METHOD: AT THE METHODOLOGICAL LEVEL, THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF DISCOURSE AND CONTENTS, AS WELL AS THE FRAMING TECHNIQUES OF THE MEDIA COVERAGE CARRIED OUT BY THE MEDIA, THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE PRESENTATION OF THE ANNULMENT APPEALS PREPARED BY THE MEDIA ARE EVALUATED. RESULTS: AS A RESULT OF THE ANALYSIS CARRIED OUT, IT IS OBSERVED THAT THE PRESENTATION OF ANNULMENT APPEALS FORMULATED BY THE POPULAR FORCE PARTY, HAD THE PARTICIPATION OF LAW FIRMS, WHO DESIGNED A LEGAL STRATEGY TO QUESTION THE RESULTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTIONS, ASSUMING A PARTICIPATION THAT IS NOT MERELY TECHNICAL, BUT ABOVE ALL POLITICAL. CONCLUSIONS: IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE PARTICIPATION OF LAW FIRMS CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD AS A MERELY TECHNICAL INTERVENTION, SINCE THE CHALLENGE OF ELECTORAL RESULTS AND THE IGNORANCE OF THE VICTORY OF THE WINNING CANDIDACY CONSTITUTES AN AFFECTATION TO THE DEMOCRATIC QUALITY THAT THREATENS THE RULE OF LAW AND THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS.
652	THE MOST RECENTLY REVISED CFP REGULATION, ADOPTED IN 2013, INCLUDES A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WITH THE AIM TO MAKE FISHERIES MORE IN TUNE WITH CONCEPT OF THE ECOSYSTEM APPROACH AND TO AVOID UNSUSTAINABLE EXPLOITATION OF MARINE BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES, INCLUDING FISH, AS A NATURAL RESOURCE. AS PART OF THAT THE CFP REGULATION INTRODUCED THE LANDING OBLIGATION, AN OBLIGATION TO LAND ALL CATCHES AS OPPOSED TO PREVIOUS PRAXIS WHERE FISHERIES HAVE BEEN RELYING ON A SYSTEM OF DISCARDING FISH AND OTHER MARINE BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE THEIR CATCH. ONE AIM WITH THE LANDING OBLIGATION IS TO PUSH FOR NEW ADAPTIVE FISHING METHODS AND IN A WAY TO IMPLEMENT AN ECOSYSTEM APPROACH SINCE THE FISHING STRATEGIES ARE MEANT TO BE ADJUSTED TO ECOSYSTEM FACTORS. TO BE EFFECTIVE, THE SYSTEM FOR CONTROLLING IMPLEMENTATION MUST BE ADJUSTED TO TAKE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE ECOSYSTEM APPROACH INTO ACCOUNT. THE PAPER PRESENTS SOME REFLECTIONS ON THE REQUIRED BALANCE BETWEEN ADAPTIVE APPROACHES CONNECTED TO THE ECOSYSTEM APPROACH AND THE STRICTNESS ESTABLISHED BY PRINCIPLES OF RULE OF LAW IN RELATION TO THE SO CALLED EU CFP LANDING OBLIGATION. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE BEST WAY TO CREATE A CONTROL SYSTEM ADJUSTED TO THESE FACTORS SEEMS TO BE BY GIVING MORE INFLUENCE TO THE INDUSTRY ITSELF. INVOLVING THOSE CONCERNED AT ALL LEVELS, AND THUS APPLYING ALL ASPECTS OF THE REGULATORY GOVERNANCE UNDER AN ECOSYSTEM APPROACH, WOULD CREATE AN EFFECTIVE ADAPTIVE SYSTEM WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS ALSO SAFE-GUARDED.
653	DO RUSSIAN COURTS CONSTRAIN THE STATE? OR DO THEY FACILITATE ARBITRARY STATE ACTION BY FAVOURING STATE AGENTS OVER OTHER LITIGANTS WHERE SUCH BIAS IS NOT BUILT INTO THE WRITTEN LAWS? ARE RUSSIAN ELECTIONS FAIR? THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS WOULD HELP US ASSESS RUSSIA'S PROGRESS TOWARDS ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW AND A DEMOCRATIC REGIME. THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT IN ELECTORAL REGISTRATION CASES WHERE INCUMBENT POLITICIANS HAVE A STAKE, THE RUSSIAN COURTS AND THE CENTRAL ELECTION COMMISSION ( CEC) ARE RESPONSIVE TO PRESSURE FROM THEM. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF ALL DENIALS OF REGISTRATION BY A DISTRICT ELECTION COMMISSION ( DEC) ASSOCIATED WITH THE 1999 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION SUGGESTS THAT THE RUSSIAN JUDICIARY WAS SUBJECT TO PRESSURE FROM THE REGIONAL AUTHORITIES. REGIONAL OPPOSITIONISTS TENDED TO SEEK REDRESS AT THE CEC, RATHER THAN AT THE LOCAL COURTS. PROTEGES OF THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION, ON THE OTHER HAND, PREFERRED TO TAKE THEIR APPEAL TO THE LOCAL COURTS. A FURTHER INDICATOR OF THE WEAKNESS OF RULE OF LAW IN RUSSIA IS THAT PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH THE LEGAL SYSTEM MADE A CANDIDATE LESS RATHER THAN MORE LIKELY TO PURSUE AN APPEAL. AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, SCATHING JOURNALISTIC ACCOUNTS OF JUDICIAL CORRUPTION, INEFFICIENCY, AND TOTAL SUBSERVIENCE TO POLITICIANS SEEM TO BE EXAGGERATED. IN 1999, BOTH THE COURTS AND THE CEC WERE ACCEPTABLE APPEAL VENUES, SINCE OPPOSITION CANDIDATES USED THEM TO DEFEND THEIR ELECTORAL RIGHTS MORE OFTEN THAN ALL OTHER GROUPS OF CANDIDATES.
654	THE TERM "DATA PHILANTHROPY" HAS BEEN USED TO DESCRIBE THE SHARING OF PRIVATE SECTOR DATA FOR SOCIALLY BENEFICIAL PURPOSES, SUCH AS ACADEMIC RESEARCH AND HUMANITARIAN AID. THE RECENT CONTROVERSY OVER AN ACADEMIC RESEARCHER'S ALLEGED MISUSE OF FACEBOOK USERS' DATA ON BEHALF OF CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA HAS BROUGHT DATA PHILANTHROPY INTO THE SPOTLIGHT OF PUBLIC DEBATE. CALLS FOR DATA ETHICS AND PLATFORM TRANSPARENCY HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE URGENT NEED FOR STANDARD SETTING AND DEMOCRATIC OVERSIGHT IN THE USE OF CORPORATE DATA FOR PUBLIC ENDS. DATA PHILANTHROPY HAS ALSO RECEIVED CONSIDERABLE SCHOLARLY ATTENTION IN VARIOUS ACADEMIC DISCIPLINES BUT HAS, UNTIL NOW, BEEN VIRTUALLY OVERLOOKED BY THE LEGAL LITERATURE. THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS AND STARTS FILLING IN THE RESULTING RESEARCH GAP BY PROVIDING THE FIRST LEGAL ACCOUNTING OF DATA PHILANTHROPY. FOLLOWING A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS AND SCHOLARLY THINKING, THIS ARTICLE HOMES IN ON A NORMATIVE ASSESSMENT OF PRIVACY RISKS THAT ARE OFTEN CITED AS A CONCEPTUAL AND PRACTICAL BARRIER TO DATA PHILANTHROPY. THIS ARTICLE REFINES THE SCOPE OF DATA PHILANTHROPY'S INFORMATIONAL RISKS AND PROPOSES A FRAMEWORK FOR MITIGATING SOME OF THESE RISKS THROUGH THE FAIR INFORMATION PRACTICE PRINCIPLES ("FIPS"). SPECIFICALLY, THE PURPOSE SPECIFICATION AND USE LIMITATION PRINCIPLES, WHICH LIMIT DATA COLLECTION TO EX-ANTE SPECIFIED PURPOSES, ARE DISCORDANT WITH THE UNANTICIPATED, EX-POST QUALITY OF DATA PHILANTHROPY. ADOPTING A NEW "DATA PHILANTHROPY EXCEPTION" WILL ACCOUNT FOR THE EXISTENCE AND NATURE OF THE PRIVACY RISKS, THE TIME FRAME FOR ACTION, THE SOCIAL RISKS OF USING THE DATA, AND THE ALLOWED RETENTION TIME FOLLOWING THE REUSE. THE DATA PHILANTHROPY EXCEPTION REINFORCES THE VALUES AT THE HEART OF THE FIPS, PROVIDES GUIDANCE IN A FIELD THAT CURRENTLY OPERATES IN A LEGAL VACUUM, AND INTRODUCES THE POSSIBILITY OF RESPONSIBLE SHARING BY AND TO SMALLER MARKET PARTICIPANTS.
655	HOW DOES EXPOSURE TO CRIMINAL VIOLENCE SHAPE ATTITUDES TOWARDS JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW? CITIZENS CARE ABOUT CRIME PREVENTION AND PROCEDURAL LEGALITY, YET THEY ALSO VALUE PUNISHING PERPETRATORS FOR THE HARM THEY HAVE DONE. WE ARGUE THAT ANGER INDUCED BY EXPOSURE TO CRIMINAL VIOLENCE INCREASES THE DEMAND FOR RETRIBUTION AND HARSH PUNISHMENTS, EVEN AT THE EXPENSE OF THE RULE OF LAW. WE TEST THIS THEORY USING ONE OBSERVATIONAL AND TWO EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES FROM AN ORIGINAL SURVEY OF 1,200 INDIVIDUALS IN WESTERN MEXICO, A REGION AFFECTED BY ORGANIZED CRIMINAL VIOLENCE AND VIGILANTISM. FIRST, WE FIRST SHOW THAT EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE IS CORRELATED WITH INCREASED ANGER AND SUPPORT FOR PUNITIVE JUSTICE, INCLUDING VIGILANTE ACTIONS. SECOND, ACROSS OUR TWO EXPERIMENTS, WE SHOW THAT CITIZENS ARE MORE SUPPORTIVE OF HARSH PUNISHMENTS AND PLACE LESS VALUE ON THEIR LEGALITY IN RESPONSE TO MORALLY OUTRAGEOUS CRIMES. THIRD, WE FIND THAT THE INNOCENCE OF THE VICTIM, RATHER THAN THE SEVERITY OF THE CRIME, IS WHAT TRIGGERS OUTRAGE AND PUNITIVENESS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT CITIZENS MAY SUPPORT EXTREME LEVELS OF VIOLENCE AS LONG AS THEY PERCEIVE THAT ITS TARGETS ARE CRIMINALS. FINALLY, WE SHOW THAT OUTRAGEOUS FORMS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST CIVILIANS CAN LEAD INDIVIDUALS TO PRIORITIZE HARSH PUNISHMENT REGARDLESS OF ITS LEGALITY. WHEN CRIMINAL ACTORS TARGET PERCEIVED INNOCENTS WITH COMMON CRIMES LIKE EXTORTION, THERE IS GREATER SUPPORT FOR HARSH, VIGILANTE ACTION. THESE PATTERNS PROVIDE A BOTTOM-UP EXPLANATION FOR HARSH JUSTICE.
656	TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF CLOUD STORAGE, IT IS NECESSARY FOR DATA OWNERS TO LAUNCH DATA INTEGRITY AUDITING (DIA) PERIODICALLY. TO FIT MORE APPLICATION SCENARIOS, THE RESEARCH DIRECTION IS SHIFTED TO DESIGN IDENTITY-BASED DIA (ID-DIA) PROTOCOLS WITHOUT EXPENSIVE PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH CAN RESIST THE QUANTUM COMPUTING ATTACKS SIMULTANEOUSLY. HOWEVER, THE EXISTING ID-DIA PROTOCOLS ARE USUALLY BASED ON HEAVY ANTI-QUANTUM COMPUTING CRYPTOGRAPHIES, WHICH MIGHT SEVERELY LIMIT THEIR PRACTICAL DEPLOYMENTS. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, WE EXPLORE THREE WAYS TO DESIGN RLWE-BASED ID-DIA (ID-DIA-RLWE) PROTOCOLS. THE FIRST IS TO IMPROVE THE EXISTING LWE-BASED ID-DIA PROTOCOLS. THE SECOND IS TO ENHANCE THE EXISTING RLWE-BASED DIA PROTOCOLS. THE THIRD IS TO INSTANTIATE THE PROPOSED SEMANTIC ID-DIA PROTOCOL. AMONG THESE THREE PROPOSED PROTOCOLS, THE THIRD ONE IS THE MOST EFFICIENT DUE TO ITS SIMPLEST CONSTRUCTION. WE ALSO PROPOSE A NEW SECURITY MODEL OF ID-DIA PROTOCOLS, INCLUDING CORRECTNESS ASSURANCE, SECURITY GUARANTEE, AND PRIVACY PROTECTION. THEN, WE PROVIDE THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF ALL PROPOSED ID-DIA PROTOCOLS UNDER THE GIVEN SECURITY MODEL. FINALLY, WE CONDUCT EXTENSIVE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND COMPARISON, WHICH FURTHER VALIDATE THAT THE THIRD PROTOCOL HAS SUPERIORITY IN THE PERSPECTIVES OF COMPUTATION, COMMUNICATION, AND STORAGE COSTS.
657	THIS PAPER EXAMINES PLATO'S LATER MODEL OF CIVIC PARTICIPATION IN RELATION TO CONTEMPORARY CIVIC THE- ORIES. IT ARGUES THAT, ALTHOUGH THE PLATONIC MODEL SATISFIES SUCH COMMON CRITERIA FOR CIVIC THEORIES AS EQUALITY, AUTONOMY, AND EMPOWERMENT, THE KEY CONCEPT TO UNDERSTAND THIS PROJECT IS MODERATION. IT IS MODERATION THAT STRUCTURES AND UNIFIES THE CONSTITUENT ELEMENTS OF THIS MODEL (THE RULE OF LAW, THE PERSUASION OF THE PREAMBLES, THE EMPOWERING ECONOMY AND EDUCATION). IT ALSO EXPLAINS WHAT KIND OF PERSONAL DISPOSITION IS CENTRAL TO ACHIEVING A STABLE AND RATIONAL POLITICAL ORDER.
658	THE PAPER PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN APPROACHES TO THE RULE-FOLLOWING PROBLEM IN THE ANALYTIC LEGAL PHILOSOPHY. THE MOST FAMOUS EXAMPLES OF THE POSSIBILITY TO APPLY THE ARGUMENTS OF WITTGENSTEIN IN LEGAL PHILOSOPHY, IN PARTICULAR THE INTERPRETATION OF THE CONTENT OF LEGAL RULES AND THEIR INTERPRETATION IN LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE CONSIDERED. THE PAPER SUBSTANTIATES THE POSITION THAT THE SPECIFICITY OF PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENTATION WITTGENSTEIN REQUIRES CLARIFICATION OF PHILOSOPHICAL AND LEGAL CONCEPTS OF "RULE", "RULE OF LAW", AND "LEGAL INTERPRETATION" FOR THE CORRECT EXPLANATION OF THE RULE-FOLLOWING PROBLEM IN LEGAL LANGUAGE.
659	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES COMMON BARRIERS TO ACHIEVING ADEQUATE LEVELS OF FOREST RESOURCE GOVERNANCE IN COUNTRIES OF LATIN AMERICA. IT LOOKS AT THE DEFICIENCIES OF THE POLICY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS AFFECTING FORESTS, THE COMMON FAILURE TO IMPOSE THE RULE OF LAW, THE MAIN FACTORS THAT CONSTRAIN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GOVERNMENT ACTIONS IN THE FOREST SECTOR AND AT THE POLITICAL BARRIERS TO INTRODUCING REFORMS FOR CHANGE IN GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES. THE ELIMINATION OF THESE BARRIERS ACQUIRES NEW IMPORTANCE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCCESSFUL REDD+ PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTRIES OF THE REGION.
660	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE SIMULTANEOUS RELATIONS BETWEEN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (CG) PRACTICE AND CASH FLOW RIGHT, CASH FLOW LEVERAGE (THE DIVERGENCE BETWEEN CONTROL RIGHT AND CASH FLOW RIGHT OF CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS). THE TWO OWNERSHIP MEASURES REFLECT ALIGNMENT AND EXPROPRIATION INCENTIVES OF CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS. THIS STUDY ALSO EXAMINES THE EFFECT OF MULTIPLE LARGE SHAREHOLDERS (MLSS) ON CG PRACTICE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE STUDY USES PUBLICLY LISTED COMPANIES (PLCS) EXCLUDING THOSE FROM THE INDONESIAN FINANCE SECTOR DURING 2011-2013 AS THE SAMPLES OF THE STUDY. TWO-STAGES LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION MODELS WERE USED TO TEST THE SIMULTANEOUS RELATIONS BETWEEN CG PRACTICE AND OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE VARIABLES. THE STUDY DEVELOPS A CG INSTRUMENT TO MEASURE CG PRACTICE BASED ON ASEAN CG SCORECARD, THAT COMPREHENSIVELY COVERS OECD CG PRINCIPLES AND THAT CAN BE USED FOR PANEL DATA. FINDINGS - CG PRACTICE HAS A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON CASH FLOW RIGHT AND HAS A MARGINALLY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON CASH FLOW LEVERAGE, WHILE CASH FLOW RIGHT AND CASH FLOW LEVERAGE HAVE A MARGINALLY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON CG PRACTICE. FURTHER, THE EXISTENCE OF LARGE MLS COMPLEMENTS CG PRACTICE, BUT AS THE CONTROL RIGHT OF THE SECOND LARGEST SHAREHOLDERS BECOMES CLOSER TO THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER, THE COMPLEMENT RELATION BECOMES LESS IMPORTANT. STATE-OR FOREIGN-CONTROLLED PLCS PRACTICE BETTER CG THAN OTHER PLCS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - STUDIES ON CG/OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE NEED TO TREAT CG AND OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE AS ENDOGENOUS VARIABLES IN THEIR RESEARCH DESIGN. IN ADDITION, THE LEVEL OF RULE OF LAW IN A COUNTRY SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN EXAMINING THE RELATION BETWEEN CG AND OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE. THE INTERRELATION AMONG CG, OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE, CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FIRM PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN STUDIED IN THE CONTEXT OF DISPERSED OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE AND STRONG RULE OF LAW. THUS, FUTURE STUDY NEEDS TO EXAMINE THE INTERRELATION AMONG THESE FOUR CONCEPTS IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGH CONCENTRATED OWNERSHIP AND WEAK RULE OF LAW. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF EXPROPRIATION, INVESTORS IN THE CAPITAL MARKET NEED TO SELECT SHARES OF PLCS THAT PRACTICE CG SUITABLE FOR THE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE OF PLCS, HAVE HIGH OWNERSHIP BY THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER AND HAVE NO DIVERGENCE BETWEEN CONTROL AND OWNERSHIP RIGHT, AND OR HAVE MLSS. PLCS MAY NEED TO CHOOSE THE LEVEL OF CG MECHANISM IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE AND CONSIDER THE BENEFITS AND COSTS IMPLEMENTING THEM. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS -THE STUDY SUPPORTS THE "ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL" PERSPECTIVE ON CG AND, THUS, IT SUPPORTS THE RECENTLY ENACTED FINANCIAL SERVICE AUTHORITY (FSA) RULE REQUIRING PLCS TO FOLLOW THE " COMPLY OR EXPLAIN" RULE ON THE CG CODE FOR PLCS. THE FSA NEEDS TO ENFORCE THE COMPLIANCE OF PLCS WITH CG RULES AND ENCOURAGE PLCS TO IMPLEMENT CG IN SUBSTANCE, NOT JUST IN FORM. TO STRENGTHEN THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF GOOD CG PRACTICE IN ATTRACTING INVESTMENTS IN CAPITAL MARKET, THE REGULATOR NEEDS TO IMPROVE INVESTOR PROTECTION RULES AND ENSURE STRONG RULE OF LAW. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE STUDY IS THE FIRST TO EXAMINE THE SIMULTANEOUS RELATION BETWEEN CG PRACTICE AND BOTH CASH FLOW RIGHT AND CASH FLOW LEVERAGE OF THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER. IT IS ALSO THE FIRST THAT INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF MLS ON CG PRACTICE. IT EXPLORES THE COMPLEMENT AND SUBSTITUTION RELATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONCEPTS IN REDUCING AGENCY COSTS. IN TERM OF RESEARCH DESIGN, THE STUDY DEVELOPS A CG INSTRUMENT THAT IS BASED ON OECD CG PRINCIPLES, THAT CAN BE USED FOR PANEL DATA AND THAT USES PUBLIC INFORMATION.
661	THE ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA AND MEXICO HAVE CHARACTERISTICS THAT DIFFERENTIATE THEM FROM THE REST OF THEIR LATIN AMERICAN COUNTERPARTS. THEY ARE ATYPICAL ARMED FORCES THAT ARE SHAPED BY THE REALITIES OF THEIR CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL HISTORY. THE FAILURE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT INSTITUTIONS HAS FORCED BOTH MILITARIES TO TAKE ON THE MISSION OF COMBATING DRUG TRAFFICKING AND INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL CARTELS. IN ORDER FOR THESE MILITARIES TO SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISH THIS MISSION, THEY MUST BE SUBORDINATED TO CIVILIAN RULE, COOPERATE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND BE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE RULE OF LAW.
662	FREE ACCESS TO PUBLIC LEGAL INFORMATION FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND PROFESSIONALS PROMOTES JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW. PRESENTERS AT THE 2015 LAW VIA THE INTERNET CONFERENCE DISCUSSED PROJECTS USING THE POWER OF TECHNOLOGY COMBINED WITH EXPERT HUMAN INPUT TO MAKE INFORMATION ACCESSIBLE, AND TO EXTRACT NEW INFORMATION FROM LARGE DOCUMENT COLLECTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE SCALE IS DIFFERENT, THERE ARE SIMILARITIES IN THE WAYS IN WHICH INDEXERS AND INFORMATICIANS EXPLORE MEANING, DEVELOP STANDARDS AND CONSIDER USER NEEDS TO MAKE INFORMATION WIDELY ACCESSIBLE. GLENDA BROWNE REPORTS ON THE CONFERENCE.*
663	AS RELATIONS BETWEEN JAPAN AND CHINA CHANGE DUE TO A PARADIGM SHIFT THAT HAS OCCURRED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, THE NEED FOR A NEW SECURITY OUTLOOK AND WORLD VIEW HAS EMERGED. IN EAST ASIA, THE FOUNDATION FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JAPAN AND CHINA MUST BE FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE, AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES WAYS THAT JAPAN AND CHINA CAN WORK TO CULTIVATE COMMON GROUND THAT WOULD BRING FORTH THE POSSIBILITY OF A NEW JAPAN-CHINA RELATIONSHIP BASED ON THE "STRATEGIC RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP" ESTABLISHED IN 2006.
664	GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE AND ROLE OF HIGH-TECH EXPORTS IN ECONOMIC GROWTH, IT IS NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY VARIABLES AFFECTING EXPORT. ACCORDINGLY, IN THIS ARTICLE WE STUDIED THE DETERMINANTS OF EXPORT FOR 24 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES DURING THE PERIOD 1996 TO 2013 BASED ON BAYESIAN MODEL AVERAGING (BMA) AND WEIGHTED-AVERAGE LEAST SQUARE (WALS) TECHNIQUE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT RULE OF LAW AS A PROXY FOR INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, HUMAN CAPITAL, IMPORT (AS A MEASURE OF OPENNESS) AND GDP WITH POSTERIOR INCLUSION PROBABILITY 100% ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLES INFLUENCING THE HIGH-TECHNOLOGY EXPORT IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
665	SLOVAKIA'S NEW STRONG MAN IS ROBERT FICO. FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE DEMOCRATIC UPHEAVAL OF 1989, FICO, TOGETHER WITH HIS PARTY SMER, SUCCEEDED IN WINNING A MAJORITY IN THE MARCH 2012 ELECTION THAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO FORM A SINGLE PARTY GOVERNMENT. IN HIS FIRST TERM, 2006-2010, FICO PURSUED A LEFT-WING, POPULIST COURSE. NOW THE PARTY HAS CHANGED. IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER SMER WILL IN FACT ACT AS A SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY, ESPECIALLY ON THE ISSUES OF DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW, AND MINORITY PROTECTION.
666	FROM THE PUBLIC'S POINT OF VIEW, HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS LINKED TO WAR AND RECONSTRUCTION. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN CONFLICT-TOM REGIONS. ON THE ONE HAND, THE PRESENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN CONSOLIDATING PEACE CREATES A MARKET FOR INFORMAL BUSINESSES SUCH AS PROSTITUTION AND TRAFFICKING IN WOMEN. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY PROTECTS HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW. A DILEMMA THUS ARISES, AS THE CASE STUDIES BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA AND KOSOVO SHOW. HOWEVER, INSTRUMENTS HAVE EVOLVED FOR FIGHTING TRAFFICKING IN WOMEN.
667	THE AUTHORS OF THE ARTICLE EXAMINE THE KANTIAN CONCEPT OF THE SUBJECT IN THE ASPECT OF THE CORRELATION BETWEEN MORALITY AND LAW, WHICH IS RELEVANT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE GLOBALIZING WORLD. ACCORDING TO KANT, MAN IS "NATURALLY PREDISPOSED" TO EVIL, THEREFORE, HE MUST FREELY CONFORM TO THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE IN ORDER TO BECOME A MORAL BEING. HOWEVER, KANTIAN ETHICS IS NOT PURELY FORMAL, SINCE IT ADMITS THE CONCEPT OF THE MORAL SENSE. DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW, KANT CONSIDERS THE RIGHT OF THE PERSONALITY TO BE SUPERIOR TO THE STATE.
668	THE CONVICTION OF MIKHAIL KHODOROVSKII AND PLATON LEBEDEV AS VILLAINOUS FIGURES GUILTY OF WHITE COLLAR CRIME WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS A SPECTACULAR SCANDAL OF JUSTICE IN THE HISTORY OF RUSSIA IN THE 21 ST CENTURY. BY SERVING AS THE HENCHMEN FOR RUSSIA'S EXECUTIVE BRANCH, WHICH HAS LONG SINCE GROWN ALL BUT OMNIPOTENT, THE GENERAL PROSECUTOR AND THE COURTS HAVE FABRICATED A CRIMINAL CASE BY SYSTEMATICALLY AND CYNICALLY VIOLATING BASIC PRINCIPLES OF RULE OF LAW. A DEFEAT FOR RUSSIA AT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN STRASBOURG HAS BEEN PRE-PROGRAMMED.
669	ORGANIZATIONS IN THE PEACEBUILDING FIELD FACE THE IMPERATIVE OF TAKING A HOLISTIC, INTEGRATED APPROACH TO PEACEBUILDING THAT COMBINES TRADITIONALLY DISTINCT DISCIPLINES SUCH AS HUMAN RIGHTS, HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE, SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, ENVIRONMENT, CONFLICT RESOLUTION, SECURITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE IN TODAY'S COMPLEX CONFLICTS. THE CONCEPT OF A NETWORK OF EFFECTIVE ACTION IS PROPOSED AS A SET OF PRACTICES FOR COLLABORATION THAT IS CAPABLE OF FACILITATING INTEGRATED APPROACHES TO PEACEBUILDING BOTH ON THE GROUND AND IN TERMS OF THE THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE FIELD.
670	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES CHANGES IN THE POSTCOMMUNIST TRANSITION IN THE EU COUNTRIES OF EAST-CENTRAL EUROPE. THE SUCCESS STORY THESIS IS DECONSTRUCTED AS THE AUTHOR PROVIDES CASES OF SOCIAL PROTESTS, SOCIOECONOMIC INJUSTICE, SHIFTS IN GEOPOLITICAL ORIENTATION, ISSUES WITH THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, WHEN MAKING A COMPARISON OF THE QUALITY OF THE TRANSITION THAT THE EU COUNTRIES OF EAST CENTRAL EUROPE HAVE MADE TO THE QUALITY OF THE TRANSITION THAT UKRAINE HAS MADE AS A NON-EU EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRY, THEN THE THESIS OF SUCCESS STORY BECOMES MORE BELIEVABLE.
671	THE JUDICIAL VIRTUES OF INDEPENDENCE, INTEGRITY AND IMPARTIALITY ARE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE PRESSURES CAPABLE OF BEING EXERTED BY CENTRES OF POWER AND WEALTH IN THE COMMUNITY, PARTICULARLY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT, REQUIRE CAREFUL ATTENTION TO THE INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. PERSONAL FORTITUDE AND RESILIENCE ARE NOT ENOUGH. INSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS ARE REQUIRED AND HAVE LONG SINCE BEEN ADOPTED. ONE IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONAL ISSUE INVOLVES THE PROCESS OF JUDICIAL APPOINTMENT. THERE IS NO SINGLE UNIVERSALLY APPLICABLE MODEL. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES SOME OF THE STRESSES ON OUR OWN SYSTEM.
672	WE EXAMINE STATE INCOME AND REPUTATION INCENTIVES TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HIGH DIVIDENDS OF PRIVATIZED FIRMS. CONSISTENT WITH THESE AGENCY-COST BASED INCENTIVES, WE SHOW STRONG AND ROBUST EVIDENCE THAT THE EXTENT OF STATE OWNERSHIP IS POSITIVELY RELATED TO CORPORATE DIVIDENDS. WE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE EMPIRICAL IMPORTANCE OF THESE INCENTIVES USING VARIATION IN THE RULE OF LAW TO PROTECT MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS, THE FISCAL DEFICIT AND THE POLITICAL ORIENTATION OF THE STATE. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT AN INCENTIVE TO ENHANCE THE STATE'S REPUTATION WITH MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS CAN ACCOUNT FOR THE HIGH DIVIDENDS OF PRIVATIZED FIRMS.
673	THIS ARTICLE RAISES REFLECTIONS ABOUT THE RESTRICTIONS THAT THE LAST MILITARY DICTATORSHIP IMPOSED ON THE PUBLIC SPACE. THROUGH THE HISTORICAL ANALYSIS OF THE TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE NOMENCLATURE, THE GEOSYMBOLS POLITICAL, REPRESENTED IN LA MONEDA, THE HOUSES OF ALLENDE AND PINOCHET, AND THE SPACES OCCUPIED BY THE REGIME, WE DELVE INTO THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT TOOK OVER THE PUBLIC SPACE INVOLVED. AFTER THE HISTORICAL REVIEW, LAYING DOWN SOME CONCLUSIONS REGARDING THE IMPACT THAT THESE CHANGES WERE IN THE PUBLIC SPACE IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A VIOLATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY.
674	ANALYSIS OF ASPECTS OF POLITICAL AND LEGAL DISCOURSE IN THE PROCESS OF THE CREATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM, CONSIDERING THE MOMENT OF TRANSITION FROM THE ANCIEN REGIME TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL ERA, INCLUDING THE CONCEPTUAL VAGUENESS OF THE VOCABULARY USED. THE ARTICLE EMPHASIZES QUESTIONS LIKE BRAZIL'S TRANSITION FROM STATE TO KINGDOM, THE NEW ORGANIZATION OF THE POLITICAL CORPUS AND CIVIL SOCIETY, THE RULE OF LAW, THE NATIONALITY AND THE CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS OF THE CITIZENS, "PORTUGUESE OF BOTH HEMISPHERES" AND THE FEAR SHOWN IN THE FACE OF MORAL REVOLUTION AND POPULAR REVOLUTION.
675	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE EVOLUTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) PROTECTION IN RELATION TO ANTI-PIRACY ACTIONS UNDERTAKEN BY THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT. THE 'WAR AGAINST PIRACY' IS BASED ON THE WORLD TRADE LEGAL STRUCTURE. THE AUTHOR'S CENTRAL ARGUMENT IS THAT THE CRIMINALIZATION OF PIRACY IS NOT THE RESULT OF A PROCESS OF NATIONAL INTEREST WHICH HAS AS ITS OBJECTIVE THE PROMOTION AND INTENSIFICATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR THE RULE OF LAW BUT, RATHER, EMERGES FROM A PUNITIVE PERSPECTIVE EMANATING FROM NETWORKS OF INTERNATIONAL INTERESTS AND TRANSNATIONAL ACTORS CHARACTERISTIC OF GLOBAL NEOLIBERALISM.
676	WE ARGUE THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE BEST CONCEIVED AS NORMS ARISING FROM A FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP THAT EXISTS BETWEEN STATES (OR STATELIKE ACTORS) AND THE CITIZENS AND NONCITIZENS SUBJECT TO THEIR POWER. THESE NORMS DRAW ON A KANTIAN CONCEPTION OF MORAL PERSONHOOD, PROTECTING AGENTS FROM INSTRUMENTALIZATION AND DOMINATION. THEY DO NOT, HOWEVER, EXIST IN THE ABSTRACT AS TIMELESS NATURAL RIGHTS. INSTEAD, THEY ARE CORRELATES OF THE STATE'S FIDUCIARY DUTY TO PROVIDE EQUAL SECURITY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, A DUTY THAT FLOWS FROM THE STATE'S INSTITUTIONAL ASSUMPTION OF IRRESISTIBLE SOVEREIGN POWERS.
677	ACCORDING TO CONVENTIONAL WISDOM, THE NATURE AND CAUSES OF THE INFORMAL SECTOR IN TRANSITION ECONOMIES IS THE SAME AS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, BUT IS THIS TRUE? THE INFORMAL SECTOR DIFFERS IN NATURE: ACTIVITIES THEREIN ARE LABOR-INTENSIVE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BUT CAPITAL-INTENSIVE IN TRANSITION ECONOMIES. FURTHERMORE, THE MAIN CAUSE OF THE SHADOW ECONOMY DURING THE POST-COMMUNIST TRANSITION IS NOT EXCESSIVE GOVERNMENT INTERVENTIONS, AS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, BUT THE LACK OF A TRADITION OF RULE OF LAW. ECONOMETRIC EVIDENCE IS PRESENTED TO SUPPORT THIS ALTERNATIVE VIEW AS A MORE PROMISING APPROACH TO RESEARCH.
678	THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF SOCIAL REGULATION HAS THE PROPERTY OF CERTAINTY OF SOCIAL RELATIONS REGULATION, INCLUDING ITS VARIETY - LAW. THE ACHIEVEMENT OF LEGAL CERTAINTY IS ONE OF THE KEY TASKS OF LAW, THIS IS ITS MEANING AND VALUE. CERTAINTY OF THE REGULATION OF PUBLIC RELATIONS IS LAID INTO THE PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW - LAW-MAKING. FOR THIS LAW-MAKER USES A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES AND METHODS. FINAL CERTAINTY IS ACHIEVED IN THE PROCESS OF LEGAL REGULATION OF THE RIGHT. TO THIS END, THE LAW USES A VARIETY OF MECHANISMS.
679	IN TRANSFORMATION RESEARCH, THE CONCEPT OF AUTHORITARIANISM IS NEGLECTED. SETTING AUTHORITARIAN SYSTEMS APART FROM THOSE THAT ARE DEMOCRATIC AND TOTALITARIAN WAS LONG CONSIDERED DESIDERATUM. LIMITED PLURALISM CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS A CENTRAL CHARACTERISTIC OF AUTHORITARIAN SYSTEMS. FOR SOME TIME, INTEREST IN THIS SUBJECT HAS BEEN GROWING. THIS IS SEEN IN THE VARIOUS FORMS OF AUTHORITARIANISMS WITH ADJECTIVES CREATED TO CAPTURE THE PECULIARITIES OF POST-COMMUNIST AUTHORITARIAN SYSTEMS. THE FEATURES OF AUTHORITARIANISMS IN THE EX-COMMUNIST REALM INCLUDE INSUFFICIENT RULE OF LAW, INEFFICIENT STATE STRUCTURES, AND INCESTUOUS RELATIONS BETWEEN POLITICS AND THE BUSINESS WORLD.
680	THE MEDIA HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL ROLE IN THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF REALITY AND IN THE STEREOTYPED REPRESENTATION OF SOME SECTORS OF IT. THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE INFORMATIVE TREATMENT OF THE BIO BIO'S TV NEWSCASTS REGARDING INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND DEALS WITH THE SOCIAL STIGMA THAT FALLS ON THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF THE AREA. MORE THAN 95 PERCENT OF THE NEWS RELATED TO THE MAPUCHE PEOPLE HAVE A NEGATIVE CONNOTATION, ASSOCIATING THE COMUNERO AS A VIOLENT PERSON, OBLIVIOUS TO THE DIALOGUE, WHO DOES NOT RESPECT THE RULE OF LAW OR THEIR INSTITUTIONS.
681	THE GOVERNMENTS OF POLAND AND HUNGARY ARE IN CONFLICT WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, WHICH REGARDS DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW AS BEING AT RISK IN BOTH STATES. HUNGARY AND POLAND REJECT SUCH CRITICISM AND INVOKE THEIR NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY. THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEW THEMSELVES AS BEING DEMOCRATICALLY LEGITIMISED. BUDAPEST AND WARSAW ARE OF THE OPINION THAT EUROPEAN INTEGRATION HAS GONE TOO FAR, AND PROPOSE A STRENGTHENING OF THE NATION STATES WITHIN THE EU. AT THE SAME TIME, POLAND AND HUNGARY ARE PURSUING DIFFERENT FOREIGN AND EUROPEAN POLICY INTERESTS AND ARE OPTING FOR DIVERGENT STRATEGIES.
682	UNDER THE ORDER OF TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW, SIMPLIFICATION OF EXTRADITION DILUTES THE LIMITS OF WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE TO FIGHT AGAINST TRANSNATIONAL IMPUNITY. JUDICIAL PROTECTION OF THE RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS AND FAIR TRIALS ARE CONTINUOUSLY ERODED IN THE INTEREST OF EFFICACY OF POLICY DECISIONS PURPORTEDLY AIMED TO WARRANT THE RULE OF LAW. THE EXPANSION OF BOTH RESOURCES AND THE GLOBAL SCOPE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IS A COROLLARY TO THIS PROCESS. THE DESTABILIZATION OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PEACE AGREEMENTS IN COLOMBIA IS A COST OF THIS NEW ORDER.
683	BUDGET STABILITY AND PUBLIC DEBT LIMITS HAVE BECOME KEY ECONOMIC POLICY FACTORS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IN THE WAKE OF THE RECENT ECONOMIC CRISIS. THE APPLICATION OF THESE PRINCIPLES INVOLVES MAJOR CUTS TO THE WELFARE STATE THAT MAY SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECT SOCIAL RIGHTS AND EVEN THE MODEL OF STATE IN OUR COUNTRY. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT BOTH THESE PRINCIPLES AND THE NEW ARTICLE 135 OF THE SPANISH CONSTITUTION MUST BE INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONSTITUTIONAL ECONOMIC RULES THAT ENSURE THE CONTINUING VALIDITY OF THE SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW.
684	A FORUM ON BORIS MIRONOV'S RUSSIAN AND ENGLISH EDITIONS OF THE SOCIAL HISTORY OF IMPERIAL RUSSIA, 1700-1917 (2000) OFFERS THE COMMENTS OF FOUR SCHOLARS ON DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF MIRONOV'S WORK. WILLIAM G. WAGNER DISCUSSES MIRONOV'S KEY CONCLUSIONS: THAT THE IMPERIAL PERIOD WAS MARKED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MORE INDIVIDUALISTIC PERSONALITY, THE DEMOCRATIC NUCLEAR FAMILY, CIVIL SOCIETY, AND A STATE ORDER BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. HE QUESTIONS, HOWEVER, THE VALIDITY OF THE MODERNIZATION PARADIGM AS AN ADEQUATE TOOL FOR ANALYZING THESE DEVELOPMENTS.
685	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE BAD AND UGLY AS THE US FEDERAL AGENCIES SEEK TO REJUVENATE COMPETITION. THE BAD IS LEGISLATIVE HIATUS TO UPDATE THE ANTITRUST LAWS FOR THE DIGITAL ECONOMY. THE UGLY IS WHEN COURTS PUSH THEIR OWN ECONOMIC BELIEFS, WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE CONGRESSIONAL INTENT AND AIMS OF THE ANTITRUST LAWS. REGARDLESS OF WHO WINS, THE RULE OF LAW (AND THOSE MOST DEPENDENT ON THE ANTITRUST LAW) SUFFER. TO CORRECT AMERICA'S MARKET POWER PROBLEM, THE ARTICLE PROPOSES RESTORING THE CONSTITUTIONAL BALANCE, WHERE THE COURTS ADJUDICATE, THE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATES, AND ENFORCERS ENFORCE.
686	GOOD GOVERNANCE IS GENERALLY BELIEVED TO IMPROVE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. THIS PAPER STUDIES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE WORLD BANK'S WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION) AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN TERMS OF GDP PER CAPITA IN KAZAKHSTAN. THE FINDINGS OF THE RESEARCH INDICATE THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOOD GOVERNANCE AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF KAZAKHSTAN. SPECIFICALLY, RESULTS SHOW THAT THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION HAS THE STRONGEST IMPACT ON GDP PER CAPITA.
687	BASED ON A THEORETICAL CONCEPT THAT DISTINGUISHES DIFFERENT DILEMMA TYPES, THE ARTICLE IDENTIFIES AND ANALYSES DILEMMA SITUATIONS THAT AROSE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL UN-LED PEACE-BUILDING OPERATION IN ITS EFFORTS TO COMBAT ORGANISED CRIME IN POST-WAR KOSOVO. IN ORDER TO COPE WITH THE VARIOUS DILEMMAS THAT AROSE, THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE-BUILDING OPERATION ENGAGED IN COMPROMISES THAT ENTAILED STRATEGIC TRADE-OFFS. DILEMMAS AND RESPECTIVE TRADE-OFFS IN DECISION-MAKING PERTAIN TO THE FIELDS OF POST-CONFLICT SECURITY, POLITICAL INCLUSION OF POST-CONFLICT STAKEHOLDERS, DISARMAMENT AND DEMOBILIZATION, TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP, RULE OF LAW AND LOCAL ECONOMY.
688	MOST OF THE DEBATE SURROUNDING THE WAR ON TERRORISM HAS FOCUSED ON HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, SUSPENSIONS, OR PARTIAL SUSPENSIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE NEED FOR BALANCE BETWEEN HUMAN RIGHTS AND SECURITY. WHILE IT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO DISCUSS THESE MATTERS, IT IS ALSO ESSENTIAL TO ASK WHETHER OR NOT U.S. SECURITY MEASURES ARE DESIGNED TO EFFECTIVELY PREVENT AND COMBAT THE CURRENT THREAT OF TERRORISM. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO DETERMINE JUST THAT, BY EVALUATING MASS REGISTRATION AND SURVEILLANCE MEASURES AND THEIR APPROPRIATENESS IN DEALING WITH THE TERRORIST THREAT.
689	THROUGH THE LENS OF GUATEMALA'S JORGE CARPIO NICOLLE CASE I ANALYZE THE MECHANISMS THAT PRESERVE IMPUNITY IN LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS STRUGGLING TO EMERGE FROM VIOLENT CONFLICT AND EMBRACE THE RULE OF LAW. I REVEAL HOW THE INFECTIVE INFLUENCE OF PARALLEL POWERS, THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS, AND OBSTRUCTIVE LEGAL DOCTRINE DESTROY DOMESTIC EFFORTS TO PROSECUTE THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. THE CARPIO CASE EXPOSES THE ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL COURTS IN PROVIDING JUSTICE WHEN DOMESTIC COURTS FAIL TO DO SO, AND IT DEMONSTRATES THE IMPORTANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS IN PURSUING THIS JUSTICE.
690	IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, A HANDFUL OF SOCIETIES BEGAN CREATING AND ENFORCING IMPERSONAL RULES, RULES THAT TREAT EVERYONE THE SAME, ON A BROAD SCALE. THE EXISTING INSTITUTIONAL LITERATURES, WHILE APPRECIATING THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPERSONAL RULES FOR THE RULE OF LAW, HAVE NOT UNDERSTOOD HOW THEY CONTRIBUTE TO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH RULES THAT ARE ENFORCED BUT NOT FOLLOWED: DEFAULT RULES. THE CONCEPTUAL IMPORTANCE OF IMPERSONAL DEFAULT RULES IS DRAWN OUT AND THEN APPLIED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND BOTH ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE LATE NINETEENTH AND EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURIES.
691	COLONISATION IN AUSTRALIA ENTAILED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS, BUT VERY OFTEN LAGGING THE EXTENSION OF THE BOUNDARIES OF SETTLEMENT. AS A COMMON-LAW INSTITUTION OF ANCIENT LINEAGE THE INQUEST WAS AN IMPORTANT MEANS OF EXPLORING REASONS FOR UNEXPLAINED DEATHS, EVEN LEADING TO PROSECUTIONS. YET THE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED BY RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS WERE NUGATORY WHERE THEY AFFECTED ABORIGINAL PEOPLE IN CONFLICT WITH SETTLER SOCIETY, AS SHOWN IN THIS STUDY OF THE MANY INQUIRIES IN WHICH DEATHS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO THE ACTIONS OF THE POLICE IN COLONIAL QUEENSLAND.
692	IN THIS ARTICLE, I WILL PROPOSE A LINE OF RESEARCH ABOUT THE THEORY AND HISTORY OF THE DOCTRINE OF PRECEDENT, ONE OF THE CRUCIAL ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW OF THE ANGLO-AMERICAN LEGAL FAMILY. AMONG OTHER THINGS, I WILL SHOW HOW THE IDEA OF PRECEDENT GOES BACK TO THE FORMATIVE PERIOD OF THE COMMON LAW. I WILL ALSO DISCUSS THE EMERGENCE OF THE MODERN DOCTRINE OF PRECEDENT AS WELL AS HOW IS RELATED TO ITS MEDIEVAL DEVELOPMENT. UPON THIS FRAMEWORK, I WILL DISCUSS MY PROPOSED LINE OF RESEARCH.
693	1. THE APPLICANT HAS FAILED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT, IN ADOPTING THE CONTESTED DIRECTIVE, THE COMMUNITY LEGISLATURE ACTED UNLAWFULLY OR COMMITTED A SUFFICIENTLY SERIOUS BREACH OF A RULE OF LAW DESIGNED TO CONFER RIGHTS ON THE APPLICANT. 2. CONSEQUENTLY, THE APPLICATION FOR DAMAGES MUST BE REJECTED WITHOUT THERE BEING ANY NEED TO RULE ON THE OTHER CONDITIONS GIVING RISE TO NON-CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY ON THE PART OF THE COMMUNITY OR ON THE PLEA OF INADMISSIBILITY RAISED BY THE COUNCIL IN RELATION TO CERTAIN ANNEXES TO THE REPLY. (OFFICIAL HEADNOTES)
694	WHEN MAY A POLITICAL PARTY'S RULES BE ENFORCED IN AN AUSTRALIAN COURT? THIS APPARENTLY SIMPLE QUESTION, OF THE JUSTICIABILITY OF DISPUTES INVOLVING MEMBERS OF PARTIES AND THEIR EXECUTIVES, HAS RECENTLY RECEIVED ITS THIRD DIFFERENT SOLUTION IN UNDER 90 YEARS, THANKS TO COURTS OF APPEAL IN TWO KEY STATES. THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY EXPLAINS THE HISTORY OF THE CASE LAW AND NORMATIVE POSITIONS IN THIS AREA. THE NEW POSITION IS FOUND TO BE RETROGRADE FOR THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN PARTIES, WHILE OFFERING AN UNCLEAR TEST FOR WHEN SUCH ISSUES MIGHT BE HEARD.
695	THIS BRIEF PAPER PRESENTS ONE POSSIBLE "TOUR" OF THREE BOOKS OF THE EXTENSIVE WORK OF GUILLERMO O'DONNELL, CONTRAPUNTOS. ENSAYOS ESCOGIDOS SOBRE AUTORITARISMO Y DEMOCRATIZACION (1997), DISONANCIAS. CRITICAS DEMOCRATICAS A LA DEMOCRACIA (2007) AND DEMOCRACIA DELEGATIVA (2011). FOR THE EXPOSITION, WE CONSIDERED THREE ANALYTICAL ISSUES: AUTHORITARIANISM, DEMOCRACY AND "RULE OF LAW", CONCEPTS THAT WERE DEVELOPED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THIS AUTHOR, IN A COMPREHENSIVE AND INTEGRATED WAY. IN ORDER TO THIS, WE CONSIDERED THOSE TEXTS AND SOME OTHERS OF THE AUTHOR AND DIFFERENT SPECIALISTS IN THE SAME ISSUES.
696	CORRUPTION IS AN OBSTACLE TO DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM IT IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL THAT PUBLIC OFFICES AND INSTITUTIONS RETAIN THEIR LEGITIMACY BY BEING ACCOUNTABLE AS STEWARDS FOR THE SCARE PUBLIC FUNDS. HOWEVER, IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY SUCH AS SOUTH AFRICA, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN ACCOUNTABLE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IN A CLIMATE THAT IS WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED TO HAVE BECOME CORRUPT. THIS PAPER REFLECTS ON THE ETHICS AND THE COST OF UNETHICAL BEHAVIOUR IN GENERAL, AND OF CORRUPTION IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA IN PARTICULAR.
697	THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO IDENTIFY RELEVANT CHARACTERISTICS OF INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE AN EFFECT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN SELECTED LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES. A MULTILEVEL MODEL WAS USED FOR THIS PROPOSE, THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE IS THE REAL PER CAPITA GDP, AND THE EXPLANATORY VARIABLES ARE INDICATORS OF GOVERNANCE PROVIDED BY THE WORLD BANK. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE SIGNIFICANT VARIABLES ARE REGULATORY QUALITY AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. THIS IMPLIES THE NEED TO STRENGTHEN THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS.
698	THE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11TH 2001 HAS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED THE UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD'S UNDERSTANDING TOWARDS THE DANGERS POSED BY TERRORISM. AS A RESULT, THE ACT (ACT) ANTI-TERRORISM LAW NO. 15 AND 16 OF 2003 WAS REGULATED AND LEGALIZED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (DPR). ANTI-TERRORISM ACT IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FUNCTIONS AS A COMPONENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND A FAIR LEGAL BASIS, AND EFFECTIVELY PREVENT THE OCCURRENCE OF ACTS OF TERRORISM. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSED ON ANALYZING THE ANTI-TERRORISM ACT BASED ON THE APPLICABLE LEGAL THEORY.
699	THE THEORY OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF ROBERT ALEXY IS BASED ON A MATERIAL CONCEPT OF RULE OF LAW. IT IS TWO-FOLD. ON THE ONE HAND, IS DEFINED BY THE TRAITS OF THE PRINCIPLES, CONSISTENT WITH THE IDEA OF CORRECT ARGUMENT. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, WEIGHT IS STILL THE LEGAL VALIDITY OF THE RULES CONTAINED CIVIL RIGHTS, CONSTITUTIONAL RULES CONSIDERED. AS ARGUED IN THE WORK, THIS AMBIGUITY OF THE NORM THEORY ALLOWS FOR DIFFERENT APPROACHES ALEXY, POSITIVIST AND POSITIVIST, WHICH IS A SIGN OF ITS THEORETICAL RICHNESS
700	FOUR YEARS AFTER MARBURY, PRESIDENT THOMAS JEFFERSON AND HIS DISTANT COUSIN JOHN MARSHALL, THEN CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES, CLASHED AGAIN IN UNITED STATES V. AARON BURR, A CASE THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF VIRGINIA. FORMER VICE-PRESIDENT WAS CHARGED WITH TREASON AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. JEFFERSON WANTED A CONVICTION WHATEVER THE COST OR THE MEANS, WHILE MARSHALL WANTED TO SECURE THE RULE OF LAW AND THE DEFENDANT'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. IMPORTANT LEGAL QUESTIONS, LIKE THE CONCEPT OF TREASON AND THE EXTENSION OF EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE, AROSE IN THIS TRIAL.
701	THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE INTERACTION BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL-CULTURAL FORCES AND GLOBALIZING NEO-LIBERAL IDEAS IN THE DISCUSSION ON THE FORMULATION OF THE DRAFT OF NEW SPATIAL PLANNING ACT IN INDONESIA. ALTHOUGH THE NEO-LIBERAL IDEAS CANNOT CHANGE THE WHOLE NATURE OF THE PLANNING SYSTEM, THIS PAPER SHOWS THAT THEY FRAGMENT THE SYSTEM AND CONFLICT WITH THE EXISTING INSTITUTIONAL-CULTURAL FORCES. IT ARGUES THAT THE IDEAS OF RULE OF LAW AND DECENTRALIZATION, AS PROMOTED BY THE NEO-LIBERALISM, SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED IN ORDER TO DEVELOP A MORE EFFECTIVE PLANNING SYSTEM IN INDONESIA.
702	JUDGES WHO LACK INDEPENDENCE ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY SUBSERVIENT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY. ANALYSIS OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS CAN EXPLAIN WHY, WHEN, AND IN WHICH TYPES OF CASES JUDGES WHO LACK SECURE TENURE STRATEGICALLY DEFECT FROM THE GOVERNMENT BY RULING AGAINST IT WHEN IT VIOLATES THE RULE OF LAW. THIS THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK EXPLAINS A NUMBER OF OTHERWISE PUZZLING DECISIONS HANDED DOWN BY THE ARGENTINE SUPREME COURT IN THE 1990S. IN A CONTEXT OF DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION, THE SCOPE OF THE COURT'S DEFECTION WAS REDUCED BUT NOT ELIMINATED.
703	USING THE CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA OF 111 DESTINATION COUNTRIES RELATED TO CHINA, THIS PAPER EXAMINES WHETHER INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY MATTERS FOR THE NEXUS BETWEEN CHINESE EMIGRATION AND OUTWARD FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) IN DESTINATION COUNTRIES. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AMPLIFIES THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF CHINESE EMIGRATION ON OUTWARD FDI, EVEN AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR POTENTIAL ENDOGENEITY WITH AN INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE APPROACH USING THE 2SLS ESTIMATION. SPECIFICALLY, THE POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE/TERRORISM, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, THE RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION WILL POSITIVELY MODERATE THE EMIGRATE-FDI RELATIONSHIP.
704	AROUND THE WORLD, DOMESTIC COURTS FOCUSED ON COMMERCIAL DISPUTES HIRE FOREIGN JUDGES. THE PRACTICE SEEMS TO RESEMBLE ARBITRATION, BUT IS ALSO ROOTED IN COLONIALISM. THESE TRAVELING JUDGES ARE PREDOMINANTLY RETIRED ENGLISH JUDGES HIRED BY SMALL, MARKET-DOMINANT JURISDICTIONS, LIKE HONG KONG OR DUBAI. THE JUDGES' IDENTITIES REVEAL EFFORTS TO HARNESS BUSINESS PREFERENCES FOR ENGLISH COMMON LAW INTO DOMESTIC COURT SYSTEMS. WHILE JUDGES ASPIRE TO SPREAD THE RULE OF LAW, LOCAL POLITICS MAY DICTATE THESE COURTS' FUTURES. THIS ARTICLE MAPS THE PRACTICE OF TRAVELING JUDGES AND EXPLORES ITS IMPLICATIONS.
705	ARTICLE 7A AND 7B CONSTITUTION OF 1945 STIPULATES THAT PRESIDENT CAN BE IMPEACHED ACCORDING TO CONSTITUTION DURING HIS ADMINISTRATION. IT SHOWS THAT INDONESIAIS A STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. RELATED TO THE PRESIDENT'S IMPEACHMENT, PARLIAMENT SERVES AS PUBLIC PROSECUTOR WHILE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT GIVES DECISION WHETHER THE VIOLATION OF CONSTITUTION EXIST OR NOT. EVEN THOUGH THE VIOLATION CAN BE PROVED, FINAL DECISION BELONGS TO PEOPLE REPRESENTATIVES ASSEMBLY WHO WILL THEN ACCEPT OR REFUSE THE COURT DECISION. TO THAT REASON, PEOPLE REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY APPLIES ITS CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY THROUGH ITS POLITICAL DECISION GRANTED TO IT.
706	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE DETERMINANT OF NON-LIFE INSURANCE CONSUMPTION IN 14 COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL AND SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE BETWEEN 1995 AND 2010 WITHIN A VECTOR ERROR CORRECTION MODEL (VECM). WE USE NON-LIFE INSURANCE PENETRATION AS A MEASURE FOR NON-LIFE INSURANCE CONSUMPTION. EMPIRICAL RESULTS PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THE NUMBER OF DWELLINGS AND NUMBER OF PASSENGER CARS POSITIVELY AND SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE NON-LIFE INSURANCE CONSUMPTION IN THE LONG RUN, WHILE THE EXISTENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND EU MEMBERSHIP ARE SIGNIFI CANT IN THE SHORT RUN.
707	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY CHANGES OCCURRING IN CHINA SINCE THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS. AN INTRODUCTION AND ANALYSIS OF THE ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AND THE RAPID POLICY SHIFTS IN PRUDENTIAL REGULATION ARE FOLLOWED BY A REVIEW OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION UNDERTAKEN IN RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS. SOME OBSERVATIONS ARE OFFERED ON THE IDEOLOGY AND ROLE OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN LEGISLATION, LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND FINANCIAL SUPERVISION. FINALLY, THE CHALLENGE OF FLEXIBLE GOVERNANCE WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW IS EXAMINED.
708	WE SHOW THEORETICALLY THAT, IN THE PRESENCE OF PERSISTENT PRODUCTIVITY SHOCKS, THE RELIANCE ON SELF-ENFORCING CONTRACTS DUE TO LIMITED LEGAL ENFORCEMENT MAY PROVIDE A POSSIBLE RATIONALE WHY COUNTRIES WITH THE WORSE RULE OF LAW MIGHT EXHIBIT: (I) HIGHER AGGREGATE TFP VOLATILITIES, (II) LARGER DISPERSION OF FIRM-LEVEL PRODUCTIVITY, AND (III) GREATER WAGE INEQUALITY. WE ALSO PROVIDE SUGGESTIVE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE CONSISTENT WITH THE MODEL'S AGGREGATE IMPLICATIONS. FINALLY, WE RELATE THE MODEL'S FIRM-LEVEL IMPLICATIONS TO EXISTING EMPIRICAL FINDINGS. (C) 2022 THE AUTHORS. PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER B.V.
709	THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CULTURAL DYNAMICS ON URBAN ECONOMIC GROWTH IN TURKISH ECONOMY. BY EMPLOYING CONFIRMATORY FACTOR AND REGRESSION ANALYSIS, IT IS FOUND THAT FOCUS ON THE FUTURE, SECULARISM, WEALTH, RULE OF LAW, WORK ETHIC, INDIVIDUALISM, RELIGION, CHARITY, RELATIONS TO BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS AND UNIVERSITIES, AND CITIZENRY ARE THE CULTURAL FACTORS WHICH HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON URBAN ECONOMIC GROWTH IN TURKISH ECONOMY. ACCORDINGLY, WHILE THE HIGHEST AND THE LOWEST POSITIVE IMPACTS STEM FROM INDIVIDUALISM AND RELIGION; THE HIGHEST AND THE LOWEST NEGATIVE IMPACTS ARISE FROM CITIZENRY AND SECULARISM, RESPECTIVELY.
710	THIS ESSAY REVISITS SOPHOCLES'S THEBAN TRAGEDIES TO QUESTION THE USUAL INTERPRETATION OF CREON AS A TYRANT INTENT ON FORCING A MASCULINE "RULE OF LAW" ON AN INNOCENT ANTIGONE. BY LOOKING AT HOLDERLIN'S GERMAN TRANSLATION OF ANTIGONE AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT KINGSHIP AND KINSHIP IN ANCIENT GREECE, I OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATION THAT SHOWS THE CHARACTER OF CREON IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT, REINFORCING CLAIMS MADE BY BERNARD WILLIAMS AND MARTIN HEIDEGGER, AMONG OTHERS, ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH WE MISUNDERSTAND THE GREEKS, AND SOME OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF DOING SO.
711	IN 2015, ABORTION ACCESS NOW PEI LEGALLY CHALLENGED THE RESTRICTIVE ABORTION POLICY OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND. THIS ARTICLE STUDIES THEIR CHALLENGE AS A UNIQUE CASE IN THE BUILDING OF A CONSTITUTIONAL FUTURE FOR ABORTION RIGHTS IN CANADA. THE ARTICLE TRACKS HOW AAN PEI DREW ON CLASSIC RULE OF LAW ARGUMENTS OF TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE TO SHAPE AND CLAIM ABORTION RIGHTS AS DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS, AN ENTITLEMENT TO FULLY AND EQUALLY PARTICIPATE IN AND BENEFIT FROM THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AS A FUNDAMENTAL SOCIAL INSTITUTION OF THE STATE.
712	THIS ESSAY BRIEFLY ANALYZES THE INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL HISTORY OF THE COUNTY OF VENASSIN SINCE ITS REFOUNDING AS PAPAL STATE IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY TO ITS DISSOLUTION DURING THE REVOLUTIONARY FRENCH EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. DURING THIS LONG PERIOD THE ESTATES WERE ORGANIZED AS A FUNDAMENTAL POLITICAL CORPORATION IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID IN CAPITAL MATTERS SUCH AS LEGAL PACTISM, TAXATION AND POLITICAL ACTION; HAVING A SET OF ELECTS AND AUDITORS PLAYING AN EXECUTIVE ROLE COMPARABLE TO OTHER REALITIES IN WHICH THE RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL DUALISM HARDLY COULD BE SUBMITTED BY ABSOLUTIST PROCESSES.
713	THIS PAPER DEMONSTRATES HOW A REQUEST FOR THE EXTRADITION OF A CANADIAN CITIZEN ACCUSED OF ONLINE CHILD LURING BY UNITED STATES AUTHORITIES OPENS UP A COMPLEX SERIES OF DOMESTIC LEGAL ISSUES REGARDING ACCESS TO, USE AND EXCHANGE OF EVIDENCE UNDER MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE REQUIREMENTS. WHILE THESE ARRANGEMENTS AIM TO PROTECT VULNERABLE CHILD VICTIMS FROM PREDATORY ONLINE BEHAVIOUR, THEY ALSO SKEW ESTABLISHED NOTIONS OF DUE PROCESS AND THE RULE OF LAW TO FAVOUR US SOVEREIGNTY AND CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT POWER. WE CONCLUDE BY EXPLAINING THE IMPACT OF THESE ISSUES ON THE DYNAMICS OF GLOBAL ONLINE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS.
714	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE DIFFERENT JURISPRUDENTIAL APPROACHES TO THE INTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTION OF PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA TO SEE WHAT THEY REVEAL REGARDING LEGITIMACY IN MODERN CHINA. IN DETAILING THE THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS AND EVALUATING THE POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS OF THE DEMOCRATIC, NORMATIVE AND POLITICAL SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT THAT COMPRISE CONTEMPORARY CHINESE JURISPRUDENCE, IT ARGUES THAT THESE JURISPRUDENTIAL SCHOOLS REVEAL THREE SOURCES THE PEOPLE, THE RULE OF LAW AND THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY AS CONSTITUTIVE AND POTENTIALLY CONTENDING SOURCES OF LEGITIMACY AND SOVEREIGNTY IN CHINESE CONSTITUTIONALISM AND POLITICS.
715	'RELOCALISATION' IS DEFINED AS AIMING TO RETURN COMMUNITIES TO A MORE LOCAL BASIS, INCLUDING IN DISASTER RISK REDUCTION. IN 2005, BOULDER VALLEY, COLORADO, USA FORMED A NON-PROFIT, NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATION TO IMPLEMENT RELOCALISATION. IN LATE 2006 AND EARLY 2007, THE GROUP'S LEADERS DECIDED TO PURSUE RELOCALISATION AS A FOR-PROFIT VENTURE AND EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED DISASTER RISK REDUCTION FROM THE RELOCALISATION AGENDA. THIS PAPER ANALYSES THESE ACTIONS AND THE CONSEQUENCES FOR RELOCALISATION THROUGH THE FRAMEWORK OF GOOD GOVERNANCE, WHICH INVOLVES THE PRINCIPLES OF PARTICIPATION, TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, RULE OF LAW, EFFECTIVENESS AND EQUITY.
716	THIS PAPER REDEEMS SCHOLARLY UNDERSTANDINGS OF TIME UNTIL THE EMERGENCE OF TIME AS A SOCIAL INSTITUTION, AS REFERRED BY FRANCOIS OST. BASED ON THIS CONCEPTION, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF FOUR MAIN MOMENTS, DURING THE PERIOD STEMMING FROM THE CIVIL-MILITARY COUP AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY IN BRAZIL, ARE APPROACHED. IN CONCLUSION, TRANSITIONAL PROCESS IN BRAZIL IS A LATE AND UNFINISHED PROCESS. AT THE TIME THAT THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION IS COMPLETING MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS OLD, IS URGENT TO GET BACK TO CONSTITUTIONAL TRANSITIONAL PROCESS, IN ORDER TO AVOID PROBLEMS IN DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW IN BRAZIL.
717	DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE FORMALLY ATTACHED TO THE PRINCIPLE, THE ITALIAN LEGAL SYSTEM IS WITNESSING A PROGRESSIVE 'WEAKENING' OF THE DUTY TO GIVE REASONS. THIS WEAKENING PROCESS SEEMS PROBLEMATIC FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE RESPECT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS VIS-A-VIS THE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION. THIS PHENOMENON THOUGH IS NOT SPECIFIC OF THE ONLY ITALIAN LEGAL SYSTEM. THE ANALYSIS OF EUROPEAN LAW AND OF THE PROVISIONS IN SELECTED MEMBER STATES HAVE SHOWN THE WEAKENING OF THE DUTY TO GIVE REASONS CAN BE CONSIDERED A WIDESPREAD ISSUE.
718	COMMONWEALTH LEADERS ARE ONCE AGAIN GATHERING WITH ONE OF THEIR NUMBER CAUGHT IN DAMAGING DISPUTES OVER DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN 1995 IT WAS NIGERIA IN TROUBLE, THIS YEAR IT IS ZIMBABWE. AND IT WAS NIGERIA THAT HOSTED TALKS TO TRY TO SETTLE THE CURRENT DISPUTE. THE RESULTING AGREEMENT COULD BE A DIPLOMATIC TRIUMPH FOR THE ORGANISATION, OR IT MIGHT TURN OUT TO BE NO MORE THAN TEMPORARY FACE-SAVING. WHAT CHANCE THEN FOR AN AGENDA THAT PROMISES CONTINUITY AND RENEWAL IN AN ORGANISATION OFTEN POORLY UNDERSTOOD?
719	JUSTICE REFORM IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PRIORITIES OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS. REFORM IS FREQUENTLY PURSUED BY SETTING UP NEW INSTITUTIONS BEYOND NATIONAL AUTHORITIES, IN ORDER TO PREVENT NATIONAL GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE WITH THEIR FUNCTIONS. THE THEORIES LINKING ECONOMIC GROWTH AND RULE OF LAW MODELS OFFER LEGITIMIZATION TO THE LEGAL TRANSPLANTS REQUIRED TO MEET INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS. THE CAMBODIAN CASE SHOWS THAT THIS CONNECTION IS OFTEN UNBALANCED AND THE REGULATION OF THE NEW MODELS SEEKS PRODUCTIVE INCREASE RATHER THAN BETTER JUSTICE IN THE FIELD OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.
720	THE WTO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MECHANISM WAS DESIGNED, INTER ALIA, TO SECURE THE 'RULE OF LAW' WITHIN INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND PROVIDE ALL MEMBERS WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS UNDER MULTILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENTS. BUT, AFTER TEN YEARS, NO SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRY HAS YET USED THE OPTION TO INITIATE A DISPUTE. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES WHAT PREVENTS THE WTO AFRICA GROUP FROM USING THE SYSTEM AND CRITICALLY REVIEWS THE SOLUTIONS THEY HAVE PROPOSED TO REMEDY THIS. IT CONCLUDES BY DISCUSSING HOW THIS REFLECTS BROADER PROBLEMS CONCERNING AFRICAN PARTICIPATION IN WTO, AND PUTS FORWARD SOME ALTERNATIVE PROPOSALS.
721	WE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN HANDED A PRECIOUS GIFT-THE CONSTITUTION.(1) THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS GIFT LIES NOT MERELY IN THE STRUCTURES FOR GOVERNMENT THAT THE DOCUMENT DETAILS BUT ALSO, MORE BROADLY, IN THE COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW. SOME IN THE CURRENT GENERATION OF JURISTS HAVE NOW ASKED THE QUESTION: "WHICH LAW SHOULD RULE US?" SOME JUSTICES ON THE SUPREME COURT HAVE BEEN LOOKING TO INTERNATIONAL LAW AND PRECEDENT TO DECIDE DOMESTIC CASES.(2) BUT IS THIS LEGITIMATE? SHOULD DECISIONS MADE IN GENEVA BIND PEOPLE IN GRAND RAPIDS?
722	THE RESEARCH AIMS TO ANALYZE THE SLAVE LABOR IN MODERN SOCIETY, ITS CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES, AS WELL AS IN WHAT WAY THE BRAZILIAN AND INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER ACT IN THE COMBAT OF THIS PRACTICE. SECONDLY, THE PAPER PROPOSES TO ANALYZE THE SOCIAL FUNCTION OF THE COMPANY INSERTED IN A MARKET ECONOMY, INCLUDING ALLUDING TO THE DRAFT OF THE NEW BRAZILIAN COMMERCIAL CODE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ASPECTS OF SUSTAINABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LEGAL ENTITY FOR THE COMMUNITY THAT IS INCLUDING THE GUARANTEES AND DIGNITY OF ITS WORKERS, ESSENTIAL COROLLARIES TO CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW.
723	LOOKING TOWARDS THE ADAPTATION OF THE SPANISH UNIVERSITY SYSTEM TO THE EUROPEAN SPACE OF HIGHER EDUCATION, WHICH IMPLIES THE REVISION OF THE DOCENT MODEL, CONTENTS AND METHODOLOGY, TO INCLUDE IN THE CURRICULA NEW SUBJECTS AS LEGAL PROFESSIONAL ETHICS, COULD BE REALLY USEFUL TO MAINTAIN A UNIVERSITY MODEL CRITICAL AS WELL AS PROFESSIONALLY AND SOCIALLY INVOLVED. BECAUSE OF THAT, IT IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP A ROL-BASED LEGAL PROFESSIONAL ETHICS, GROUNDED IN THE PRINCIPLES OF RULE OF LAW AND FUNDAMENTAL LIBERTIES, THAT ALLOW TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM THE MORAL APPROACH.
724	THE WIDESPREAD ASSUMPTION THAT REDUNDANCY NECESSARILY LEADS TO INEFFICIENCY IS INCORRECT. PARALLEL BUREAUCRACIES CAN CONTRIBUTE TO MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE POLICY OUTCOMES, AND THEIR ABSENCE CAN LEAD TO WASTEFUL AND UNPRODUCTIVE ATTEMPTS AT POLICY IMPLEMENTATION. IN CHINA, INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND INTERBUREAUCRATIC COMPETITION OVER OVERLAPPING JURISDICTIONS EXPLAIN WHY COPYRIGHT ENFORCEMENT, WHERE REDUNDANCY IS ABSENT, IS POOR AND TRADEMARK ENFORCEMENT, WHERE REDUNDANCY IS PRESENT, HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL. THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE FRAMEWORK TO STUDY POLICY IMPLEMENTATION AND SUGGEST FUTURE CHINESE COMPLIANCE PATTERNS WITH WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION RULES AND PROSPECTS FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA
725	THE POPULARISATION OF GLASER'S GROUNDED THEORY (GT) METHODOLOGY IN CHINA OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES OR SO HAS SEEN SOME FAITHFUL USE OF CLASSIC (GLASERIAN) GT IN SEVERAL AREAS (I.E. PSYCHOLOGY, CULTURE OF RULE OF LAW, AND NURSING) AMID THE OVERALL MISUSE AND ABUSE OF THE METHODOLOGY. AND ARISING FROM THESE ENDEAVOURS ARE SOME LIFE-CHANGING EXPERIENCES OF GT RESEARCHERS LEADING TOWARDS THEIR ACADEMIC INDEPENDENCE. THESE INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES COVER THREE INTERTWINING ASPECTS, NAMELY INSPIRATION AND EMPOWERMENT OF GLASER AND HIS METHODOLOGY, DEVELOPING A CRITICAL MIND, AND GROWTH IN PERSONAL CHARACTER.
726	IF A COUP D'ETAT, OF NECESSITY, OVERTURNS THE RULE OF LAW, THEN IT IS BOTH UNUSUAL AND POTENTIALLY SELF-DEFEATING FOR A COURT TO RULE ON ITS LEGALITY. THAT IS WHY CASES ON COUPS ARE BOTH RARE AND THE OBJECT OF FASCINATION. HOW DOES A COURT, IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, ACCOMMODATE THE STRICT APPLICATION OF THE LAW WITH RECOGNITION OF THE REALITY OF A NEW GOVERNING REGIME AND THE SERIOUS RISK TO PUBLIC SAFETY THAT MIGHT FLOW FROM ITS JUDGMENT? THIS WAS THE DILEMMA FACING THE FIJIAN COURT OF APPEAL IN APRIL 2009.
727	THOUGH IT HAS A RELATIVELY BRIEF HISTORY IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE, PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION (PIL) HAS CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. PIL FACES NUMEROUS OBSTACLES IN THE POST-COMMUNIST REGION, INCLUDING INADEQUATE LEGAL AID; A LIMITED PRO BONO PUBLICO TRADITION; AND RULES OF PROCEDURE AND JUDICIAL PRACTICE THAT ARE UNRECEPTIVE TO JOINT CLAIMS, PROOF OF SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS, AND EQUITABLE REMEDIES. THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE DEVELOPMENT OF PIL, SURVEYS THE CHALLENGES, AND OFFERS CONCRETE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DONORS AND OTHERS CONCERNED TO FOSTER SUSTAINABLE AND EFFECTIVE PIL IN THE FUTURE.
728	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE ROLE OF STRUCTURAL FACTORS-GOVERNANCE AND RULE OF LAW, CORPORATE SECTOR GOVERNANCE (CREDITOR RIGHTS AND SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS), CORPORATE FINANCING STRUCTURE-AS WELL AS MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES IN CURRENCY CRISES. USING A TECHNIQUE KNOWN AS A BINARY RECURSIVE TREE ALLOWS FOR INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE VARIOUS EXPLANATORY VARIABLES. IT IS FOUND THAT STRUCTURAL VULNERABILITIES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE OCCURRENCE OF "DEEP" CURRENCY CRISES (THOSE WITH A REAL GDP GROWTH DECLINE OF AT LEAST 3 PERCENTAGE POINTS) AND THAT THERE ARE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THESE STRUCTURAL VULNERABILITIES AND MACROECONOMIC IMBALANCES.
729	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HAS GREAT POTENTIAL IN ALL AREAS OF OUR LIVES, BUT IT ALSO PRESENTS RISKS FOR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE EUROPEAN UNION IS TRYING TO CREATE A BALANCED REGULATORY FRAMEWORK BETWEEN THE PROS AND CONS OF AI. ON 21 APRIL 2021 EU PUBLISHED A COMPREHENSIVE PROPOSAL FOR AN AI REGULATION, WHICH SHOULD PROTECT AND PROMOTE EUROPEAN RIGHTS AND VALUES, WITHOUT IMPEDING THE TECHNOLOGICAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF AI. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO GIVE A FIRST ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSAL, FOCUSING ON ITS MAIN POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASPECTS.
730	THE ROLE OF THE UK SUPREME COURT (UKSC) AS CONVENTIONALLY UNDERSTOOD IS TO GIVE EFFECT TO, AND NOT TO CHALLENGE, THE WILL OF PARLIAMENT. AT THE SAME TIME, THE UK'S CONSTITUTION FORCES THE UKSC TO DEVELOP A CONSTITUTIONAL JURISPRUDENCE TO RESOLVE CLASHES OF HIGHER-ORDER PRINCIPLES, FOR INSTANCE BETWEEN PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS DEVELOPMENT PUTS THE LEGITIMACY OF UNELECTED AND UNACCOUNTABLE JUDGES INVALIDATING LEGISLATION UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT. INSTEAD OF ARGUING FOR US-STYLE STRIKE-DOWN POWERS, I ARGUE THAT CAUTIOUS AND CORRECTIVE JUDICIAL INTERVENTION IS CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED AND DEMOCRATICALLY LEGITIMATE.
731	SOME OF MARCEL AYME'S MOST DELIGHTFUL WORK CONCERNS CHARMING ROGUES, PROTAGONISTS WHO LACK THE HEROISM OF MORAL OUTLAWS SUCH AS ROBIN HOOD OR THE GOLEM OF JEWISH LITERATURE BUT ACT OUTSIDE THE RULE OF LAW IN A WAY THAT IS PSYCHOLOGICALLY IF NOT ALWAYS MORALLY COHERENT. ON OTHER "LAW AND LITERATURE" OCCASIONS, AYME EMPLOYS WHAT IS SOMETIMES CALLED FANTASY, BUT HAS THE SARDONIC BITE OF MAGICAL REALISM - WHAT THIS ANALYSIS CONSIDERS "MAGICAL LEGALISM", WHERE INDIVIDUALS CIRCUMVENT PHYSICAL, NATURAL, AND POSITIVE LAW IN ATTEMPTS TO ACHIEVE PURE SELF-EXPRESSION OR EGOCENTRIC NOTIONS OF JUSTICE.
732	THIS REVIEW EXPLORES THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF A EUROPEAN RULE OF LAW. IT RUNS COUNTER TO MOST LEGAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCE SCHOLARSHIP WHICH CONSIDERS SUCH TRANSNATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER TO BE THE DIRECT OUTCOME OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE'S JUDICIAL FIAT IN A COUPLE OF REVOLUTIONARY DECISIONS FROM THE 1960S. DRAWING FROM THE THEORY OF FIELDS AS WELL AS FROM THE SOCIOLOGY OF LEGAL PROFESSIONS, THE REVIEW SUGGESTS AN ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNT OF THIS LEGAL REVOLUTION AS EMBEDDED IN A COMPLEX LEGAL AND POLITICAL STRUGGLE OVER THE NATURE AND FUTURE OF EUROPE.
733	TRUMP'S LANGUAGE IS A LANGUAGE THAT BYPASSES DEMOCRACY FOR THE BENEFIT OF OLIGARCHIES. IT IS THE LANGUAGE OF THE ORATOR PLAYING THE POPULIST CARD AND REDUCES VOTERS TO CUSTOMERS GOING AGAINST NON-CUSTOMERS. AN ORATOR LOOKING FOR-AND INDEED FINDING ALONG THE WAY-INTEREST GROUPS THAT WILL SUPPORT AND FINANCE HIS DODGES AND HEADLONG RUSH. IN ORDER TO FIGHT THIS LANGUAGE, WE MUST, YET AGAIN AND EVERY DAY, CONVINCE OURSELVES THAT A WORLD WHERE THE RULE OF LAW OBTAINS AND WHERE FREEDOMS ARE SAFEGUARDED IS THE WINNING HAND.
734	IT SEEMS TO BE IN OUR TIMES SOME LEGAL AND POLITICAL SCHIZOPHRENIA. ON THE ONE HAND IS PROCLAIMED THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE, THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRATIC, SOCIAL, CULTURAL STATE, ETC., ON THE OTHER IT IS SAID THAT WE ARE IN AN INFORMATION SOCIETY, AS SYNONYMOUS OF THE CONTEMPORARY, AND SOME AUTHORITATIVE VOICES IDENTIFY THAT PARADIGM WITH LESS DEMOCRACY AND SOMEHOW EXILE OR SUBORDINATION OF THE CONSTITUTION, WHICH SEEMS EVEN SUPERFLUOUS BEFORE THE MAGNIFICENT TECHNICAL POWER. UNDER THESE CONTRADICTORY CIRCUMSTANCES, IS PLURALISM STILL IS POSSIBLE, AND WHAT KIND OF LEADERS WILL BE ENGENDERED?
735	ON MARCH 5, 2019 THE LEGAL COMMUNITY CELEBRATES THE 75TH BIRTHDAY OF SERGEY GEORGIEVICH MIKHAILOV, DEAN OF THE FACULTY OF LAW AT PERM STATE UNIVERSITY, PROFESSOR, HONORED LAWYER OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. S. G. MIKHAILOV'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEGAL EDUCATION IN THE PERM REGION AND THE FACULTY OF LAW AT PERM STATE UNIVERSITY IS OF GREAT VALUE, AS WELL AS HIS PROFESSIONAL PARTICIPATION IN INTRODUCING THE RULE OF LAW AND CIVIL SOCIETY, IN PROMOTING HIGHER EDUCATION AND CERTIFICATION OF THE ACADEMIC STAFF IN PERM AND THE REGION.
736	FELIX FRANKFURTER, RENOWNED AS A PUBLIC INTELLECTUAL FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE, BECAME AS A MEMBER OF THE SUPREME COURT A FIGURE PROCLAIMING HIS DEVOTION TO THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS COROLLARY, JUDICIAL SELF RESTRAINT, EVEN WHEN ITS RESULTS CONFLICTED WITH HIS DEEPEST BELIEFS. YET AN ANALYSIS OF SEVERAL OF HIS LEADING OPINIONS SUGGESTS THAT HIS FAMOUS BALANCING TESTS HAD LITTLE TO DO WITH LAW. IN SACRIFICING HIS POLICY AND ETHICAL GOALS IN THE SERVICE OF LAW, HE OFTEN FAILED TO SERVE THE LAW, AND IN THAT SENSE, HIS WELL PUBLICIZED SACRIFICES WERE FOR NOTHING.
737	RECENTLY, THE IDEA OF A WORLD ORDER WHICH WOULD GUARANTEE UNIVERSAL PEACE, OBEYING THE RULE OF LAW NOT THE RULE OF FORCE, HAS FREQUENTLY BEEN EVOKED, THOUGH NOT WITHOUT SECOND THOUGHTS. THIS IDEAS ORIGINATES IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY, AND PARTICULARLY IN KANT. HENCE IT IS FIRST OF ALL TO UNDERSTAND WHERE OUR OWN IDEAS COME FROM THAT WE SHOULD REREAD THE PAGES HE DEVOTES TO THIS THEME. AT THE SAME TIME, REDISCOVERING THE SENSE AND THE FUNCTION OF COSMOPOLITAN LAW IN KANT AVOIDS LETTING IT SIMPLY BE CONFISCATED BY THOSE WHO ADOPT IT.
738	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE CONTRIBUTION OF EUROPEAN POLITICAL PARTIES TO DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING. IT FOCUSES ON THE EUROPEAN PEOPLE'S PARTY'S EFFORTS TO PROTECT THE HUNGARIAN GOVERNMENT, AND THE EUROPEAN CONSERVATIVES AND REFORMISTS PARTY'S PERMISSIVE ACCEPTANCE OF THE POLISH GOVERNMENT'S ATTACKS ON DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, ANALYSING THESE PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOUR AS A FORM OF COMPLICITY IN DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING. IN A SECOND STEP, THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE EXISTING POSSIBILITIES AND NORMATIVE JUSTIFICATION FOR SANCTIONING EUROPEAN POLITICAL PARTIES THAT MAKE A COMPLICIT CONTRIBUTION TO DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING.
739	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE FOLLOWING POINTS: WHAT ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WE FIND OURSELVES AND ARE WE URGED TO MODIFY THEM IN ORDER TO DRAW A PREDICTABLE FUTURE? WHAT UNDERLIES AND WHAT NEW ELEMENTS OF THE AUGUST 2016 INSTITUTIONAL COUP? OR WHERE DID WE COME FROM, WHAT BROUGHT US HERE AND HOW TO INTERPRET THE PRESENT? FINALLY, WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES AND TASKS THAT ARE REQUIRED OF US TO CHANGE CIRCUMSTANCES IN TERMS OF KNOWLEDGE AND THE RESTORATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE FRAGILE DEMOCRATIC ORDER?
740	THE RECENT HISTORY OF THE TUNISIAN BAR WAS SYMPTOMATIC OF REPEATED ATTEMPTS BY PRESIDENT BEN 'ALI'S AUTHORITARIAN STATE TO SUBJUGATE A PROFESSION WHICH WAS MEANT TO GUARANTEE RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND DEFENDANTS' RIGHTS. TO THIS END, THE STATE ESTABLISHED AN APPARATUS INTENDED TO CONTROL THE WORKINGS OF THE LEGAL SERVICES MARKET AND REDUCE THE PROFESSION'S CAPACITY FOR SELF-REGULATION. THIS SITUATION LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ILLEGAL PRACTICES AND INFLUENCED A MAJORITY OF LAWYERS TO SUPPORT THE MOBILIZATION AGAINST BEN 'ALI'S REGIME.
741	THE CRISIS THE UNITED STATES IS WITNESSING IN ARIZONA OVER IMMIGRATION IS THE RESULT OF A FAILED IMMIGRATION POLICY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.(1) THE ARIZONA LAW IS A SYMPTOM AND A CRY FOR HELP. HOWEVER, THE CONSTITUTION PLACES THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMMIGRATION ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, NOT ON THE STATES. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT CONGRESS ACT SOONER THAN LATER TO REFORM OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. IT IS A MATTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY, DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY, AND NATIONAL IDENTITY. WHILE UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW, WE MUST DEVISE A SYSTEM THAT IS COMPASSIONATE AND JUST.
742	THERE IS A GROWING TREND TOWARDS SECURITIZATION OF THE MARITIME COMMONS, WHICH SERIOUSLY IMPACTS SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES GOVERNANCE COOPERATION. THIS IMPACT IS MAINLY REFLECTED IN THE FACT THAT IT UNDERMINES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES GOVERNANCE, WHICH IS FRAGMENTED AND RUNS BASED ON COUNTRIES' WILLINGNESS. IT MAKES THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL BASIS FOR SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES GOVERNANCE COOPERATION MORE FRAGILE. AS A RESULT, COUNTRIES ARE MORE INCLINED TO TAKE THE ISSUES OF SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES GOVERNANCE AND ITS SUB-ISSUES AS SECURITY-RELATED ISSUES OR TOOLS FOR ACHIEVING MARITIME SECURITY STRATEGIES. ULTIMATELY, IT WILL LEAD TO CONFRONTATION RATHER THAN COOPERATION IN SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES GOVERNANCE. EVIDENCE THAT CAN SUPPORT THIS THEORY IS FROM COMBATING IUU FISHING, A SUB-ISSUE OF SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES GOVERNANCE, IN THE NORTHEAST ASIA PACIFIC AND THE SOUTH CHINA SEA. FROM SECURITIZATION THEORY AND INTERNATIONAL LAW THEORY PERSPECTIVES, DESECURITIZATION IS THE CORE OF THE SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING THE DESECURITIZATION OF THE MARITIME COMMONS AND THE DESECURITIZATION OF ITS SUB-ISSUES. IN PRACTICE, DESECURITIZATION INCLUDES IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES GOVERNANCE AND ESTABLISHING REGIONAL COOPERATIVE GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS. THE RESULT WILL CERTAINLY HELP TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES GOVERNANCE COOPERATION ON A REGIONAL AND GLOBAL SCALE.
743	BLOOM FILTER IS A BIT ARRAY (A ONE-DIMENSIONAL STORAGE STRUCTURE) THAT PROVIDES A COMPACT REPRESENTATION FOR A SET OF DATA, WHICH CAN BE USED TO ANSWER THE MEMBERSHIP QUERY IN AN EFFICIENT MANNER WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF FALSE POSITIVES. IT HAS A LOT OF APPLICATIONS IN MANY AREAS. IN THIS PAPER, WE EXTEND THE DESIGN OF BLOOM FILTER BY USING A MULTIDIMENSIONAL MATRIX TO REPLACE THE ONE-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE WITH THREE DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTATIONS, NAMELY OFFF, WOFF, FFF. WE REFER THE EXTENDED BLOOM FILTER AS FENG FILTER. WE SHOW THE FALSE POSITIVE RATES OF OUR METHOD. WE COMPARE THE FALSE POSITIVE RATE OF OFFF WITH THAT OF THE TRADITIONAL ONE-DIMENSIONAL BLOOM FILTER AND SHOW THAT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITION, OFFF HAS A LOWER FALSE POSITIVE RATE. TRADITIONAL BLOOM FILTER CAN BE REGARDED AS A SPECIAL CASE OF OUR FENG FILTER.
744	ANNUALLY, HUMAN RIGHTS DAY IS CELEBRATED ON DECEMBER 10, THE DATE, WHEN, IN 1948, THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, WAS TRANSLATED INTO THE LARGEST NUMBER OF LANGUAGES AND BECAME THE MOST INFLUENTIAL IN THE WORLD, WAS ADOPTED BY THE UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATION GENERAL ASSEMBLY. THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION IMPROVED THE DAILY LIVES OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, INDESCRIBABLE SUFFERING, AND CONRAINS THE FOUNDATIONS OF A MORE EQUITABLE IN THE WORLD.THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION PROMISES ALREADY POLITICAL SAFETY FOR THE PEOPLE, ETERNAL VALUES OF EQUALITY, JUSTICE AND HUMAN DIGNITY. THIS YEAR, DECEMBER 10, 2018, WE HAVE CELEBRATED THE 70-TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION CONSTITUTED A WORLD WOUNDED BY WAR AS A MEANS, PRESCRIBED BY THE STATES.IT WAS COMPILED BY THE REPRESENTATIVES AND ENDORSED BY THE LEADERS OF THE COUNTRIES FROM ALL CONTINENTS, WHICH NOT ONLY PROVIDES FOR CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS, BUT ALSO SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL RIGHTS.
745	E. DIAZ PRESENTS IN THIS TEXT THE MAIN LINES OF HIS LEGAL PHILOSOPHY CONCEPTION.
746	BUILDING ON THE RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL LITERATURE, AS WELL AS EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON URBAN CASES, THIS ARTICLE DETERMINES AND DISCUSSES FIVE CORE VALUES OF GOOD URBAN GOVERNANCE: RESPONSIVENESS, EFFECTIVENESS, PROCEDURAL JUSTICE, RESILIENCE, AND COUNTERBALANCE. THE QUEST FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE CAN TAKE VARIOUS FORMS. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON URBAN GOVERNANCE, AND IDENTIFIES FOUR DIFFERENT SHIFTS, WITH INCREASED EMPHASIS ON THE REAL DECISION MAKERS OR THE ORDINARY CITIZENS, WITH INCREASED ATTENTION TO SELECTIVE CHOICE OR INTEGRATIVE DELIBERATION AS MODES OF URBAN GOVERNANCE. URBAN GOVERNANCE AND GOOD URBAN GOVERNANCE ARE NOT SYNONYMOUS. THIS ARTICLE ADVOCATES CRITICAL REFLECTION, MOVING BEYOND THE PERFORMANCE BIAS THAT TENDS TO ACCOMPANY GOVERNANCE REFORM.
747	VARIOUS DUE PROCESS PROVISIONS DESIGNED FOR USE BY CIVIL SERVANTS IN ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION-MAKING MAY BECOME REDUNDANT WHEN AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING IS TAKEN INTO USE IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. PROBLEMS WITH MECHANISMS OF GOOD GOVERNMENT, RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR AUTOMATED DECISIONS AND THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRE ATTENTION OF THE LAW-MAKER IN ADAPTING LEGAL PROVISIONS TO THIS NEW FORM OF DECISION-MAKING. ALTHOUGH THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IS IMPORTANT IN ACKNOWLEDGING AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING, MOST OF THE LEGAL SAFEGUARDS WITHIN ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS HAVE TO BE PROVIDED FOR BY THE NATIONAL LAW-MAKER. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT ALL COUNTRIES HAVE A NEED TO REVIEW THEIR RULES OF ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS WITH A VIEW TO BRINGING THEM UP TO DATE REGARDING THE REQUIREMENTS OF AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING. IN WHICHEVER WAY THE LEGISLATION IS FRAMED, THE KEY ISSUES ARE THAT PERSONS WHO DEVELOP THE ALGORITHM AND THE CODE AS WELL AS PERSONS WHO RUN OR DEAL WITH THE SOFTWARE WITHIN PUBLIC AUTHORITIES ARE AWARE OF THE PREVENTIVE SAFEGUARDS OF LEGALITY IN THE CONTEXT OF AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING, NOT ONLY OF THE REACTIVE SAFEGUARDS CONSTITUTED BY THE COMPLAINT PROCEDURES, AND THAT LEGAL MECHANISMS EXIST UNDER WHICH THESE PERSONS CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND LIABLE FOR DECISIONS PRODUCED BY AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING. IT IS ALSO ARGUED THAT ONLY RULE-BASED SYSTEMS OF AUTOMATIZED DECISION-MAKING ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND THAT THERE IS A GENERAL INTEREST IN PREVENTING A DEVELOPMENT INTO A RULE OF ALGORITHM.
748	AS DISCUSSIONS ON THE REFORM OF INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT DEEPEN AND GATHER MOMENTUM AT THE UNITED NATIONS COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW (UNCITRAL), THIS ARTICLE DELVES INTO A SPECIFIC AND FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE: THE REQUIREMENT THAT ADJUDICATORS IN INVESTMENT DISPUTES ARE AND REMAIN INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL. IT BEGINS BY EXPLAINING THE PRINCIPLE OF INDEPENDENCE AND IMPARTIALITY IN INTERNATIONAL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS, WITH A FOCUS ON ARBITRAL INSTITUTIONS. THE ARTICLE THEN HIGHLIGHTS A RANGE OF SPECIFIC CONCERNS THAT THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF INVESTOR-STATE ARBITRATION RAISES IN RESPECT OF INDEPENDENCE AND IMPARTIALITY. FINALLY, IT PROVIDES A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF HOW DIFFERENT REFORM PROPOSALS PRESENTLY DISCUSSED WITHIN UNCITRAL WORKING GROUP III WOULD FARE IN TERMS OF DELIVERING A DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISM THAT ENSURES INDEPENDENCE AND IMPARTIALITY. RATHER THAN PROVIDING ONE SPECIFIC SOLUTION, THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS DISCUSSED, WITH THE AIM TO HELP BOTH POLICY-MAKERS CONSIDERING REFORM AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND SCHOLARS.
749	JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE DID NOT ONLY BECOME MORE VISIBLE IN THE RECENT CASE LAW OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE BUT HAS ALSO BEEN ANALYSED AS A SYSTEMIC PARAMETER OF THE UNION. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES A SAMPLE OF THREE CASES, ASSOCIACAO SINDICAL DOS JUIZES PORTUGUESES, ACHMEA, AND L.M., TO ASSESS THE NOTION OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AS APPLYING REGARDING THE NATIONAL JUDGES IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF THE UNION. JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, AS A NOTION OF EU LAW, IS PRIMARILY A CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT PRESUMABLY DEFERENT TO MEMBER STATES' STANDARDS AND PURSUING THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF THE UNION'S JUDICIAL SYSTEM, NAMELY ITS EFFECTIVENESS. HOWEVER, THE RECENT CASE LAW TESTIFIES THE EMERGENCE OF A COMMON EU STANDARD OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, WHICH DOES NOT ONLY APPLY AS A MINIMUM STANDARD THROUGHOUT THE UNION BUT ALSO AFFECTS THE NATIONAL LEGAL ORDERS. ULTIMATELY, THE ANALYSES OF THE PAPER POINT OUT A CURIOUS HARMONY REGARDING JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE BETWEEN THE PRINCIPLES OF EFFECTIVENESS OF UNION LAW AND OF EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION UNDER THAT LAW WITHOUT CLARIFYING THEIR ARTICULATION.
750	FROM THE DEEPWATER HORIZON DISASTER TO THE OPIOID CRISIS, MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION-OR SIMPLY MDL-HAS BECOME THE PREEMINENT FORUM FOR DEVISING SOLUTIONS TO THE MOST DIFFICULT PROBLEMS IN THE FEDERAL COURTS. MDL WORKS BY REFUSING TO FOLLOW A REGULAR PROCEDURAL PLAYBOOK. ITS SOLUTIONS ARE CASE SPECIFIC, EVOLVING, AND AD HOC. THIS VERY FLEXIBILITY, HOWEVER, PROVOKES CHARGES THAT MDL VIOLATES BASIC REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW. AT THE HEART OF THESE CHARGES IS THE ASSUMPTION THAT MDL IS SIMPLY A LARGER VERSION OF THE LITIGATION THAT TAKES PLACE EVERY DAY IN FEDERAL DISTRICT COURTS. BUT MDL IS NOT JUST DIFFERENT IN SCALE THAN ORDINARY LITIGATION; IT IS DIFFERENT IN KIND. IN STRUCTURE AND OPERATION, MDL PARALLELS PROGRAMS LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY IN WHICH AN ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY CONTINUOUSLY DEVELOPS NEW PROCEDURES TO HANDLE A HIGH VOLUME OF CHANGING CLAIMS. ACCORDINGLY, MDL IS APPROPRIATELY JUDGED AGAINST THE "ADMINISTRATIVE" RULE OF LAW THAT EMERGED IN THE DECADES AFTER WORLD WAR II AND UNDERPINS THE LEGITIMACY OF THE MODERN ADMINISTRATIVE STATE. WHEN ONE VIEWS MDL AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROGRAM INSTEAD OF A LARGER VERSION OF ORDINARY CIVIL LITIGATION, THE REAL THREATS TO ITS LEGITIMACY COME INTO FOCUS. THE PROBLEM IS NOT THAT MDL IS AD HOC. RATHER, IT IS THAT MDL LACKS THE GUARANTEES OF TRANSPARENCY, PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, AND EX POST REVIEW THAT ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES HAVE OPERATED UNDER SINCE THE MIDDLE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. THE HISTORY OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE SUGGESTS THAT MDL'S CONTINUED SUCCESS AS A FORUM FOR RESOLVING STAGGERINGLY COMPLEX PROBLEMS DEPENDS ON HOW IT ADDRESSES THESE GOVERNANCE DEFICITS.
751	THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE DEMOCRATIC STATE-LEGAL REGIME IN THE LIGHT OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY THREATS. IT IS NOTED THAT THE PRESENCE OF FORMAL FEATURES OF A DEMOCRATIC REGIME DOES NOT ALWAYS ENSURE THE FUNCTIONING OF SUCH MECHANISMS AND INSTITUTIONS OF DEMOCRACY AS THE DIVISION OF POWER, FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ASSEMBLY, FAIR ELECTIONS AND OTHERS. THE MAIN INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL DESTRUCTIVE ELEMENTS INFLUENCING BOTH SETTLED AND DEVELOPING LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC REGIMES ARE DETERMINED. EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON THE DESTRUCTIVE ACTIVITIES OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IN DESTROYING AND DISCREDITING THE BASIC INSTITUTIONS OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES AND POPULARIZING THE CHINA MODEL OF AN UNDEMOCRATIC STATE-LEGAL REGIME. THE INFLUENCE OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS, POLITICAL, SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL AND MILITARY FACTORS ON THE TRANSFORMATION OF LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC REGIMES AND THE WORLD GLOBAL ORDER IS REVEALED. THE DANGER (FOR THE WHOLE LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC WORLD IN GENERAL AND UKRAINE IN PARTICULAR) OF THE USE OF SUCH A PHENOMENON AS "HYBRID WAR" BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SPREAD OF THE FASCIST CONCEPT OF "RUSSIAN WORLD" IS POINTED OUT. IT IS PROVED THAT THERE IS THE NEED TO PRESERVE A LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC STATE-LEGAL REGIME, AS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL OF ALL REGIMES OFFERED TO HUMANITY, FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.
752	PURPOSE: THE AIM WAS TO ANALYZE INSOLVENCY PROCEEDINGS IN GERMANY, CROATIA AND SLOVAKIA AND ANSWER THE RESEARCH QUESTION WHETHER INSOLVENCY PROCEEDINGS ARE OPENED TOO LATE IN THE OBSERVED COUNTRIES AND HOW THIS ISSUE CAN BE EXPLAINED. METHODOLOGY: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF INSOLVENCY SYSTEMS IN GERMANY, CROATIA, AND SLOVAKIA WAS CON-DUCTED. FURTHERMORE, THE FINANCIAL PROFILE (LIQUIDITY) OF FIRMS IN PRE-INSOLVENCY AND INSOLVENCY PROCEEDINGS IN GERMANY, SLOVAKIA AND CROATIA WAS ANALYZED AND RESPECTIVE RESULTS WERE COMPARED WITH DATA ON GOVERN-MENT EFFECTIVENESS AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE OBSERVED COUNTRIES. THE ONE-WAY ANOVA WAS PERFORMED TO TEST THE DIFFERENCES IN LIQUIDITY AMONG COMPANIES THAT INITIATED PRE-INSOLVENCY AND INSOLVENCY PROCEEDINGS. RESULTS: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT GERMAN COMPANIES RESPOND TO SIGNS OF CRISES EARLIER IN COMPARISON TO CROATIAN AND SLOVAKIAN COMPANIES AND THESE DIFFERENCES CANNOT BE EXPLAINED ONLY BY CRIMINAL LAW MEAS-URES WHICH ARE NOT EQUALLY EFFECTIVE ACROSS JURISDICTIONS, BUT THEY DEPEND TO A LARGE EXTENT ON GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND THE RULE OF LAW IN A COUNTRY. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SHOW THAT DESPITE THE SIMILARITIES IN THE CIVIL LAW FRAMEWORKS, INSOLVENCY PROCEED-INGS IN CROATIA AND SLOVAKIA ARE STILL INITIATED ON AVERAGE MUCH LATER THAN IN GERMANY. MOREOVER, ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS, CRIMINAL LAW SANCTIONS AGAINST THE LATE INITIATION OF INSOLVENCY PROCEEDINGS CAN HAVE PREVEN-TIVE EFFECTS. HOWEVER, WHILE THEY CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TIMELY INSOLVENCY PROCEEDINGS, THEIR EFFECTIVE-NESS IS STILL LIMITED BY THE EFFICIENCY OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM MEASURED BY THE STRENGTH OF INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR CONSISTENT APPLICATION.
753	DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN THE LAW AND JUSTICE SECTOR HAVE TRADITIONALLY FOCUSED ON REFORMING STATE LEGAL INSTITUTIONS TO THE EXCLUSION OF CUSTOMARY LEGAL SYSTEMS. THIS IS OFTEN BECAUSE OF HOST COUNTRY PRESSURE TO ACHIEVE QUICK RESULTS, LIMITED FAMILIARITY OF FOREIGN LAWYERS WITH THE CONCEPTS OF CUSTOMARY LAW, AND DONOR RELUCTANCE TO SUPPORT CUSTOMS THAT SUBSTANTIVELY OR PROCEDURALLY VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS. YET, RULE OF LAW PRACTITIONERS DEPLOYED TO DEVELOPING AND POST-CONFLICT COUNTRIES ARE INCREASINGLY CONFRONTED WITH THE REALITY THAT CUSTOMARY LEGAL SYSTEMS ARE THE PREFERRED AND, FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, THE ONLY VIABLE MEANS OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION AVAILABLE TO THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE. GIVEN THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THE HIGH LEVEL OF RECOURSE TO CUSTOMARY LAW, THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT CUSTOMARY LEGAL SYSTEMS ARE INTEGRAL TO DEVELOPMENT, AND THAT BOTH CUSTOMARY AND STATE LEGAL SYSTEMS HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN A FUNCTIONAL JUSTICE SECTOR. HOWEVER, THERE IS LITTLE SYSTEMATIC GUIDANCE FOR PRACTITIONERS IN THE FIELD, MANY OF WHOM HAVE HAD NO PREVIOUS EXPOSURE TO CUSTOMARY LAW, ON EXACTLY WHAT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO ENGAGE BOTH SYSTEMS AND THE ISSUES THAT DIFFERENT TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS RAISE. THIS PAPER SETS OUT A FRAMEWORK OF POLICY OPTIONS FOR PROGRAMS THAT SEEK TO HARNESS THE RESPECTIVE STRENGTHS OF CUSTOMARY AND STATE LEGAL SYSTEMS, GIVING EXAMPLES OF INITIATIVES THAT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DO THIS. THE PAPER CONCLUDES BY PROPOSING GOOD PRACTICES FOR RULE OF LAW PRACTITIONERS TO FOLLOW IN SUPPORTING CUSTOMARY AND STATE LEGAL SYSTEMS THAT CO-EXIST IN A MANNER WHICH ADVANCES PEACE, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.
754	COMMITMENT TO THE 'RULES-BASED ORDER' ('RBO') HAS EMERGED AS A LEADING DISCOURSE AMONG ADVOCATES FOR STABILITY IN GLOBAL ORDER. YET, DESPITE THE MOST AUTHORITATIVE RULES BEING THOSE AGREED BETWEEN STATES TO BE LEGALLY BINDING, IT IS PRIMARILY POLITICAL VOICES THAT ADVOCATE IN THESE TERMS, OFTEN ASSUMING THAT THEY ALSO EMBODY LAWYERS' COMMITMENT TO THE 'INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW'. LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP HAS IN CONTRAST REMAINED SCEPTICAL ABOUT THE MEANING OF THE RBO AND ALIVE TO THE PERILS OF UNITING LEGAL AND NON-LEGAL RULES WITHIN A SINGLE NORMATIVE IDEAL. THIS ARTICLE DEFINES THE RBO IN JURISPRUDENTIAL TERMS IN ORDER TO INTERROGATE A CORE STRATEGIC ASSUMPTION DRIVING THE DISCOURSE: THAT ESTABLISHING NON-LEGAL RULES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW COMPLEMENTS AND REINFORCES BINDING LEGAL RULES GOVERNING THE SAME SUBJECT MATTER. IN POSITIVIST TERMS, THE RBO GENERALLY REFERS TO THE ORDER OF LEGAL AND NON-LEGAL RULES OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE BUT HAS INCREASINGLY DEVELOPED A SECONDARY MEANING AS A COMPARATIVE CONCEPTION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW INFORMED BY PARTICULARISTIC WESTERN AND LIBERAL NOTIONS OF GLOBAL ORDER. USING THE CASE OF THE PROPOSED ASEAN-CHINA CODE OF CONDUCT IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA, THE ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE RBO AND THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW HAVE BECOME ANTAGONISTIC NORMATIVE IDEALS IN CASES WHERE LEGAL RULES HAVE FAILED TO CONSTRAIN THE SELF-JUDGING INTERPRETATIONS OF A GEOPOLITICALLY DOMINANT STATE. STATES MUST INSTEAD LOOK BEYOND SUBSTITUTING ONE CATEGORY OF RULES FOR ANOTHER AND SEEK TO CONSTRUCT THE GEOSTRATEGIC BALANCES OF POWER NECESSARY FOR A RBO THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW.
755	TURKEY'S PROPOSED ENTRY INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) HAS BEEN UNDERMINED BY EUROPEANS' PERCEPTIONS OF TURKISH-EUROPEAN CULTURAL DIFFERENCES, PARTICULARLY REGARDING THE LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC VALUES THAT THE EU PROMOTES (DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW, AND RESPECT FOR AND APPRECIATION OF MINORITY/HUMAN RIGHTS). YET, CROSS-NATIONAL RESEARCH ON VALUES HAS NOT FOCUSED ON TURKEY, THE EU, AND THESE LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC VALUES, LEAVING ASSUMPTIONS OF CULTURAL DIFFERENCES AND THEIR EXPLANATIONS UNTESTED. THROUGH ANALYSES OF WORLD AND EUROPEAN VALUES SURVEY DATA (1999-2002), THIS ARTICLE ASKS WHETHER PEOPLE IN TURKEY HAVE THE SAME VALUES REGARDING DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW (VERSUS RELIGIOUS AND AUTHORITARIAN RULE), AND MINORITY/HUMAN RIGHTS AS PEOPLE IN EU MEMBER AND CANDIDATE STATES (AS OF 2000)? WHAT FACTORS EXPLAIN THESE VALUES? I FIND THAT PEOPLE IN TURKEY SUPPORT DEMOCRACY TO THE SAME EXTENT AS PEOPLE IN EU MEMBER AND CANDIDATE STATES, BUT PEOPLE IN TURKEY ARE MORE SUPPORTIVE OF RELIGIOUS AND AUTHORITARIAN RULE AND ARE LESS TOLERANT OF MINORITIES. ALTHOUGH THE 'CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS' THESIS EXPECTS LIBERAL VALUES TO BE ORDERED ACCORDING TO COUNTRIES' RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS, WITH WESTERN CHRISTIAN THE MOST SUPPORTIVE AND ISLAMIC THE LEAST, ONLY FOR TOLERANCE OF MINORITIES VALUES IS THIS PATTERN FOUND. INSTEAD, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT MOST CONSISTENTLY EXPLAINS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TURKEY AND EU MEMBER AND CANDIDATE STATES IN SUPPORT FOR THESE VALUES. I CONCLUDE WITH CALLS FOR THEORETICAL REFINEMENT, PARTICULARLY OF THE CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS THESIS, ALONG WITH SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH TO EXAMINE MORE MUSLIM AND ORTHODOX COUNTRIES; I DISCUSS THE DEBATE OVER TURKEY'S EU ENTRY.
756	OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES THERE HAS BEEN A RESURGENCE OF INTEREST, ON THE PART OF BOTH ACADEMICS AND PRACTITIONERS, IN USING LAW TO PROMOTE DEVELOPMENT IN LATIN AMERICA, SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE, AND ASIA. THE LEVEL OF ACADEMIC INTEREST IN THE TOPIC IS REFLECTED IN THE PUBLICATION OF THREE RECENT BOOKS ON LAW AND DEVELOPMENT BY PROMINENT AMERICAN SCHOLARS: THOMAS CAROTHERS (ED.), PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW ABROAD: IN SEARCH OF KNOWLEDGE, KENNETH DAM, THE LAW-GROWTH NEXUS: THE RULE OF LAW AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND DAVID TRUBEK AND ALVARO SANTOS (EDS.), THE NEW LAW AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: A CRITICAL APPRAISAL. IN THIS ESSAY WE SUGGEST THAT THESE BOOKS (OR AT LEAST SOME CONTRIBUTIONS TO THEM) REFLECT INSENSITIVITY TO THE AMBIGUITIES SURROUNDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEGAL REFORM AND DEVELOPMENT. WE SHOW THAT THERE IS ONGOING DEBATE ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS SUCH AS WHETHER LAW IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN DETERMINING SOCIAL OR ECONOMIC OUTCOMES IN DEVELOPING SOCIETIES GIVEN THE EXISTENCE OF INFORMAL METHODS OF SOCIAL CONTROL; WHETHER THERE ARE INSURMOUNTABLE ECONOMIC, POLITICAL OR CULTURAL OBSTACLES TO EFFECTIVE LEGAL REFORM; AS WELL AS, ASSUMING EFFECTIVE LEGAL REFORM IS FEASIBLE, WHAT TYPES OF REFORMS ARE CONDUCIVE TO DEVELOPMENT AND WHAT TYPES OF ACTORS OUGHT TO IMPLEMENT THEM. WE ARGUE THAT ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME REASONS FOR OPTIMISM ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF LEGAL REFORMS UPON DEVELOPMENT, THE RELEVANT EMPIRICAL LITERATURE IS INCONCLUSIVE ON MANY IMPORTANT ISSUES AND COUNSELS CAUTION ABOUT THE WISDOM OF CONTINUING TO INVEST SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES IN PROMOTING LEGAL REFORM IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WITHOUT FURTHER RESEARCH THAT CLARIFIES THESE ISSUES.
757	THE CONCEPT OF THE "OUTLAW" PROVIDED ANTEBELLUM ABOLITIONISTS WITH A POWERFUL RHETORICAL WEAPON IN THEIR CHALLENGE TO THE SOUTHERN SLAVE SYSTEM. THEY VIGOROUSLY CONDEMNED THE PRACTICE OF PLACING SLAVES AND FREE BLACKS OUTSIDE THE LAW THROUGH OFFICIAL AND INFORMAL OUTLAWRY. CALLING ATTENTION TO RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN CRIMINAL LAWS AND THE UNDER-PROTECTION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS AGAINST VIOLENCE, CRITICS CONTENDED THAT SYSTEMATICALLY EXCLUDING A LARGE CATEGORY OF PEOPLE FROM THE PROTECTION OF LAW FLOUTED FOUNDATIONAL AMERICAN VALUES, MOST NOTABLY RULE OF LAW, EQUAL PROTECTION, AND DUE PROCESS. YET THERE WERE VARIATIONS IN THE WAYS ABOLITIONISTS USED THE OUTLAW CONCEPT. PARTICULARLY SHARP DISTINCTIONS IN TACTICS AND STANDPOINTS ARE EVIDENT BETWEEN BLACKS AND WHITES, AS WELL AS BETWEEN LAWYERS AND CLERGYMEN. DIFFERENCES ARE ALSO APPARENT BETWEEN THOSE WILLING TO WORK WITHIN THE POLITICAL SYSTEM AND THOSE ESCHEWING POLITICS. SOME ABOLITIONISTS USED OUTLAW RHETORIC IN AN ABSTRACT MANNER TO DEMONIZE SLAVEHOLDER REGIMES AND PROVIDE IDEOLOGICAL SUPPORT FOR RULE OF LAW, WHILE OTHERS USED IT TO ENCOURAGE AN ACTIVE ROLE BY AFRICAN AMERICANS IN ENDING SLAVERY AND ACHIEVING RACIAL EQUALITY THROUGH RESISTANCE ON SOUTHERN PLANTATIONS AND IN NORTHERN STREETS. TACTICALLY, SOME INSISTED ON THE IMPORTANCE OF OBEDIENCE TO LAW WHILE OTHERS DECLARED THE ILLEGITIMACY OF OPPRESSIVE LAWS AND THE NEED TO DEFY THEM WITH VIOLENCE IF NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE JUSTICE. ANALYSIS OF ABOLITIONISTS' USE OF THE CONCEPT OF THE OUTLAW, WHICH REVEALS A PREVIOUSLY UNEXAMINED ELEMENT OF LEGAL RHETORIC, NOT ONLY EXEMPLIFIES DIVERGENT APPROACHES WITHIN THE ABOLITIONIST CAMPAIGN BUT ALSO ILLUMINATES EARLY AMERICAN CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON RACIAL ISSUES THAT PERSISTED LONG AFTER THE CIVIL WAR.(1)
758	THE DOMINANT STRAIN OF LAW AND DEVELOPMENT THEORY HOLDS THAT STRONG PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH. NONETHELESS, CHINA HAS EXPERIENCED THIRTY YEARS OF FRENETIC GROWTH ABSENT STRONG PROPERTY RIGHTS. THIS NOTE EXPLORES THIS PHENOMENON THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF A UNIQUE CORPORATE FORM THAT HAS COME TO UNDERLIE MOST OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED CHINESE INTERNET SECTOR-THE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE). THE VIE IS, AT ITS CORE, A SERIES OF CONTRACTS DESIGNED TO MIMIC "TRUE" OWNERSHIP. AS SUCH, THE VIE PROBLEMATIZES LAW AND DEVELOPMENT THEORY IN TWO PRIMARY WAYS. FIRST, THE CONTRACT-BASED OWNERSHIP SYSTEM DOES NOT PROVIDE THE CLEAN TITLE ENVISIONED BY MOST LAW AND DEVELOPMENT THEORISTS, AND CONSEQUENTLY RAISES ISSUES RELATED TO CONTROL. SECOND, THE OWNERSHIP CLAIM OF THE INVESTOR IS LIKELY JUDICIALLY UNENFORCEABLE. ACCORDINGLY, THE INCREASING PREVALENCE OF THE VIE STRUCTURE AND THE SIMULTANEOUS ECONOMIC GROWTH ENJOYED BY CHINA'S INTERNET SECTOR NATURALLY LEADS TO A NUMBER OF INTERRELATED CONCLUSIONS. FIRST, THE VIE SHOWS THAT WEAK PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY BE SUFFICIENT IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY NONETHELESS PROVIDE NOTICE OF WHO "OWNS" THE PARTICULAR ITEM AT ISSUE (I.E., IT SERVES A TITLE-CLEARING FUNCTION). SECOND, CULTURALLY SPECIFIC, EXTRALEGAL INSTITUTIONS AND METHODS MAY VINDICATE RIGHTS IN THE ABSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIRD, PREDICTABILITY, AN IMPLICIT PURPOSE OF THE PROPERTY RIGHTS REGIME, MAY ALLOW FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH ABSENT STRONG PROPERTY RIGHTS. READ TOGETHER, THESE THREE CONCLUSIONS SUGGEST THAT THE ACADEMY HAS TAKEN A GOOD IDEA-THE ALMOST UNIVERSAL EMPHASIS OF RULE OF LAW AND PROPERTY RIGHTS-AND STRETCHED IT BEYOND THE CONFINES OF ITS NATURAL UNIVERSE.
759	TIMES OF EMERGENCY, FOR THE SAKE OF PUBLIC ORDER AND LEGALITY ITSELF, THE RULE OF LAW MUST BE TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED. IN CROATIA AND IN MANY OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THE COURSE WHICH THE EXECUTIVE MUST THEN TAKE IS CONSTITUTIONALLY REGULATED. A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA HAS BEEN IN FORCE FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS. ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION, WHENEVER A STATE OF EMERGENCY REQUIRES IT, THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECREE LAWS (NOTVERORDNUNGEN) AND TAKE EXTRAORDINARY (EMERGENCY) MEASURES. SUCH ACTS ARE JUSTIFIED DURING A STATE OF ACTUAL WAR, A REAL THREAT TO STATE INDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY, AS WELL AS OF A STATE OF INTERNAL, LEGAL AUTHORITIES DISORDER. DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF SUCH STATES, THE RIGHT TO SUSPEND THE RULE OF LAW IS A PREROGATIVE INHERENT IN THE PRESIDENT GROUNDED UPON THE CONSTITUTION. AT THE SAME TIME, THE PARLIAMENT - OR THE PRESIDENT, IF IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE PARLIAMENT TO BE IN SESSION - CAN ENACT EXTRAORDINARY POWERS OF INTERFERENCE WITH PERSONAL LIBERTIES AND HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS. THE AUTHOR COMPARES SUCH CROATIAN REGULATIONS WITH FRENCH, SPANISH, AND PORTUGUESE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDERS ON STATES OF EMERGENCY. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THOSE FACTS, THE AUTHOR TRIES TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA IS DOING NECESSARY, AND NOT MORE THAN IS NECESSARY, TO PROTECT PUBLIC ORDER IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY? BY DOING SO, IS HE UNDERTAKING ALL THE USUAL MEASURES COMPRISING SKILL AND CAUTION, SO AS TO DO NO MORE HARM THAN COULD BE REASONABLY AVOIDED?
760	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF CORRUPTION AND INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ON CAPITAL FLIGHT IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - USING A PORTFOLIO CHOICE FRAMEWORK, THE STUDY EMPLOYS TWO DIFFERENT ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES AS GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENT AND FIXED EFFECT REGRESSION ON PANEL DATA SETS OF 32 COUNTRIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA OVER THE PERIOD 2000-2012. FINDINGS - THE VARIABLE OF INTEREST, CORRUPTION, RETAINS ITS EXPECTED POSITIVE SIGN AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ACROSS ALL THE ESTIMATIONS. THE RELATIONSHIP REMAINS VERY STRONG EVEN WHEN OTHER EQUALLY IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES SUCH AS REGIME DURABILITY, RULE OF LAW AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE EXECUTIVE ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. THIS SUGGESTS THAT A HIGHER PERCEPTION OF CORRUPTION AMONG PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AS IN BRIBERY, KICKBACKS IN PUBLIC PROCUREMENT, EMBEZZLEMENT OF PUBLIC FUNDS, AMONG OTHERS FACILITATES AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL OUTFLOW FROM SSA. THE FINDINGS FURTHER INDICATE THAT REGIME DURABILITY AND RULE OF LAW ARE IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES THAT ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE CAPITAL FLIGHTS IN SSA. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE FINDINGS IMPLY THAT INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED IF SSA IS TO WIN THE WAR AGAINST CORRUPTION AND BY EXTENSION AGAINST CAPITAL FLIGHT. THERE SHOULD BE A CREATION OF DEMOCRATIC ENVIRONMENT AND GOOD GOVERNANCE PRACTICES THAT FOSTER STRONGER GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS, DECLINE IN CORRUPTION AND BETTER DOMESTIC INVESTMENT CLIMATE TO HELP REVERSE THE HIGH SPATE OF CAPITAL FLIGHT IN THE REGION. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE MAIN VALUE OF THIS PAPER IS USING THE PORTFOLIO CHOICE FRAMEWORK TO ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CAPITAL FLIGHT AND CORRUPTION IN THE SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN CONTEXT.
761	THE TACTICS AND STRATEGIES EMPLOYED BY THE UNITED STATES IN ITS 'WAR ON TERRORISM' HAVE GENERALLY BEEN CONDEMNED AS DEPARTURES FROM THE NORMS OF HOW A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT CONDUCTS ITSELF. REFORMS ARE THUS THOUGHT NEEDED TO PLACE THE 'WAR ON TERROR' UNDER THE RULE OF LAW AND PROTECT CIVIL LIBERTIES. THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO COUNTER THAT VIEW. USING PREDICTIVE DATA MINING-A TECHNOLOGY AT THE HEART OF THE US NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY'S (NSA) SURVEILLANCE SCANDAL-AS AN EXAMPLE, IT ARGUES THAT RATHER THAN A BREAK WITH THE PAST, THE TACTICS THAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION ADOPTED TO FIGHT TERRORISM REPRESENT AN EXTENSION OF A PARTICULAR TYPE OF FUTURE-ORIENTED POWER WHICH FOUCAULT (2008) REFERRED TO AS "SECURITY" OR "GOVERNMENT." AND WHILE INDIVIDUAL CIVIL LIBERTIES ARE NO DOUBT AT STAKE, THEY ARE NOT AT STAKE EQUALLY FOR EVERYONE. PREDICTIVE DATA MINING DISCRIMINATES BY DESIGN, DESIGNATING CERTAIN GROUPS AS THREATS RELATIVE TO OTHERS. THUS, PERSONS WITH MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTH AFRICAN BACKGROUNDS WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY BEAR THE BURDEN OF THIS SURVEILLANCE TECHNIQUE AND THE INNUMERABLE MISTAKES IT PRODUCES. FINALLY, THE RULE OF LAW WOULD SEEM TO OFFER LITTLE TO REMEDY THE SITUATION. THE WAR ON DRUGS, THE POLICING OF IMMIGRATION, AND PAST INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES WITH 'TERRORIST REGIMES' HAVE PROVIDED A "CRIME JURISPRUDENCE" (SIMON 2007) THAT LEGITIMIZES SUCH DISCRIMINATION. PARADOXICALLY AND PESSIMISTICALLY THEN, THE REAL HOPE FOR CHANGE LIES IN THE CRISIS OF LEGITIMACY THAT ONE COULD EXPECT TO RESULT FROM THE WIDER APPLICATION OF SUCH DISCRIMINATORY TECHNOLOGIES OR THE BENEVOLENT REIGN OF AN EXECUTIVE BRANCH THAT HAS BEEN IMBUED WITH AN AUTHORITY BEYOND ITS TRADITIONAL LIMITS.
762	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE 'HUMAN RIGHTS REVOLUTION' FOR PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW IN GENERAL AND WTO LAW IN PARTICULAR. THE UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION OF HUMAN RIGHTS CALLS FOR THE CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND FOREIGN POLICIES BASED ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND PRINCIPLES OF RULE OF LAW, LIMITATION AND SEPARATION OF GOVERNMENT POWERS, SOCIAL JUSTICE, 'DEMOCRATIC PEACE', AND NATIONAL AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL CONSTITUTIONALISM. THE EIGHT CORE PRINCIPLES OF CONSTITUTIONALISM MUST BE APPLIED IN A MUTUALLY COMPLEMENTARY MANNER AT LOCAL, NATIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS WHEREVER POWER RISKS BEING ABUSED. CONSTITUTIONALISM IS DESCRIBED AS A BOTTOM-UP STRUGGLE FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN DIGNITY IN THE KANTIAN SENSE OF MAXIMUM EQUAL LIBERTY FOR THE PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL. THE WTO GUARANTEES OF FREEDOM, NON-DISCRIMINATION, RULE OF LAW, COMPULSORY ADJUDICATION OF INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES, AND OF A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL DIVISION OF LABOR ARE SHOWN TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE SIX BASIC FUNCTIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS LAW. THE EMERGING 'RIGHT TO DEMOCRACY' AND THE INCREASING FOCUS ON 'POSITIVE INTEGRATION LAW' IN WTO NEGOTIATIONS CALL FOR DEMOCRATIC REFORMS OF WTO LAW AND OF ITS 'CONSTITUTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE' FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CITIZENS. UN HUMAN RIGHTS LAW MUST OVERCOME ITS LONG-STANDING NEGLECT OF ECONOMIC LIBERTIES, PROPERTY RIGHTS AND OF COMPETITION LAW AS A NECESSARY COMPLEMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THE UNIVERSALIZATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND OF WTO LAW OFFER MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL SYNERGIES THAT REQUIRE INCREASED COOPERATION BETWEEN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS, THE WTO, AND THE WORLD TRADE COMMUNITY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CITIZENS AND THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS.
763	THE ISRAELI DEMOCRACY REGULATES THE OPERATION OF THE JUDICIARY THROUGH THE CONSTRAINTS OF FORMAL RULES THAT CHECK THE POLITICAL ACTORS, THE INDIVIDUAL JUDGES, AND THE JUDICIARY. BASIC LAWS, LAWS AND REGULATIONS PRESCRIBE THE OPERATION OF EVERY SUBJECT. YET BEYOND THESE FORMAL RULES, INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS AND PRACTICES ARE SOMETIMES EQUALLY IMPORTANT IN THE OPERATION OF THE JUDICIARY, AS THEY ARE IN ANY CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM. IN ISRAEL, SOME OF THESE INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS ARE CRUCIAL FOR THE FLOURISHING OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, THROUGH THEIR PROTECTION OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE FROM EXTERNAL POLITICAL INTERFERENCE. THE IMMINENT POSSIBILITY THAT POLITICAL ACTORS MAY SET SOME OF THEM ASIDE IS NOTHING LESS THAN A POTENTIAL TRANSFORMATION IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER. OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES, JUDGES AND COURT ADMINISTRATORS HAVE INTRODUCED OTHER INTERNAL INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ISRAELI JUDICIARY, WHICH QUALIFY FORMAL JUDICIAL ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS IN WAYS THAT MAY PROVE TO BE DETRIMENTAL TO DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE IMPORTANT IN THE OPERATION OF THE ISRAELI JUDICIARY, SEPARATING THE FORMER EXTERNAL KIND THAT ARE CONDUCIVE TO THE RULE OF LAW-SUCH AS THE ILLEGITIMACY OF POLITICAL AND PARTISAN CONSIDERATIONS IN JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS-AND WHOSE DISREGARD MAY SIGNAL DEMOCRATIC DECAY FROM THE LATTER INTERNAL KIND THAT MAY PROVE DETRIMENTAL TO THE COURTS-SUCH AS OPAQUELY CHANGING WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COURT ADMINISTRATION. LASTLY, THE POLITICAL ATTEMPT TO CHANGE INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS, DETAILED HEREIN, CAN BE SEEN AS A HARBINGER OF THE CURRENT ATTEMPT TO CHANGE FORMAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATUS OF THE JUDICIARY IN ISRAEL.
764	THE STUDY AIMS TO DISCOVER THE VARIABLES THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE STABILITY OF JORDAN'S POLITICAL SYSTEM, DESPITE THE BARRIERS AND CONDITIONS THAT THE JORDANIAN STATE HAS FACED FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY IN THE WORLD'S TENSEST REGION. IT BEGAN WITH A HYPOTHESIS: THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN JORDAN'S STABILITY AND THE LEGITIMACY OF THE REGIME, WHICH IS FOUNDED ON VOLUNTARY CONSENT BETWEEN THE LEADERSHIP AND THE PEOPLE, AS WELL AS LOYALTY TO THE LEADERSHIP, BELONGING TO THE HOMELAND, THE RULE OF LAW, AND RESPECT FOR THE CONSTITUTION. THE STUDY REPRESENTED JORDAN'S STABILITY FEATURES, STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, AND CURRENT POSITION ON THE WORLD'S POLITICAL MAP IN THE FIRST CENTURY. THE STUDY'S SCIENTIFIC AND PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE LIES IN CLARIFYING JORDAN'S NATURE AND THE GROWTH, PROGRESS, AND PROSPERITY THAT THIS COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING AT ALL LEVELS, DESPITE THE CHALLENGES IT FACED DURING THE CENTENNIAL; AND IN ASSISTING RESEARCHERS, SCHOLARS, POLITICIANS, AND DECISIONMAKERS IN SIMILAR COUNTRIES TO JORDAN IN DETERMINING HOW TO BENEFIT FROM JORDAN'S EXPERIENCE AS A ROLE MODEL. THE STUDY USED HISTORICAL, DESCRIPTIVE-ANALYTICAL, SYSTEMS ANALYTICAL, AND DECISIONMAKING METHODOLOGIES TO ANSWER THE STUDY'S QUESTIONS AND EXAMINE ITS PREMISE. IT CONCLUDED THAT THE RULING REGIME'S RELIGIOUS, HISTORICAL, AND POLITICAL LEGITIMACY, AS WELL AS ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE HASHEMITES, THE NATURE OF JORDANIAN SOCIETY, AS WELL AS THE RULE OF LAW AND INSTITUTIONS, NATIONAL UNITY, AND THE STRONG MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LEADERSHIP AND THE PEOPLE, ALL CONTRIBUTED TO JORDAN'S CENTURY-LONG PROCESS OF POLITICAL STABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT.
765	THE EXTENT TO WHICH DEMOCRATIC REGIMES WARRANT THE RULE OF LAW IS CONSIDERED TO BE VITAL FOR THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY. THUS, THE PERCEIVED TRUSTWORTHINESS OF THE POLICE, AS THE EXECUTIVE AGENCY OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM, IS ATTRIBUTED A SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE. NOTWITHSTANDING, THE BULK OF EMPIRICAL STUDIES CONCERNED WITH POLITICAL SUPPORT HAS SO FAR NOT FOCUSED ON TRUST IN THE POLICE IN ITS OWN RIGHT BUT RATHER AS AN INGREDIENT OF POLITICAL TRUST WHICH ENCOMPASSES TRUST IN REPRESENTATIVE AND IMPARTIAL INSTITUTIONS ALIKE. BY CONTRAST, EMPIRICAL STUDIES IN THE FIELD OF POLICE RESEARCH INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF PERSONAL ENCOUNTERS WITH THE POLICE AND THE HEREBY CONVEYED SENSE OF FAIRNESS. IN A MULTILEVEL ANALYTICAL SETTING, THIS STUDY DRAWS ON THE ESS 2010 DATA AND AIMS TO TRACE THE EFFECTS OF POLITICAL ATTITUDES, PERSONALITY TRAITS AND PERSONAL VALUES ON VARIOUS INDICATORS OF POLICE LEGITIMACY AND BY SIMULTANEOUSLY TAKING SELECTED MACRO-LEVEL INDICATORS AND THEIR CROSS-LEVEL EFFECTS INTO ACCOUNT. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE POLICE ARE, IN PART, A FUNCTION OF WHETHER CITIZENS ARE POLITICALLY INVOLVED OR RATHER ALIENATED. MOREOVER, THEY CORROBORATE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF PERSONAL ENCOUNTERS WITH THE POLICE. YET, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE EFFECTS ARE DETRIMENTAL ALSO DEPENDS ON THE CONTEXTUAL SETTING. IN COUNTRIES WHERE SOCIAL TRUST IS HIGH AND THE RULE OF LAW ABOUNDS, PERSONAL CONTACTS HARDLY LEAVES A NEGATIVE TRACE. AS A CONSEQUENCE, POLICIES THAT AIM TO ENHANCE POLICE LEGITIMACY MAY BE LESS FRUITFUL IF ITS INTERPLAY WITH THE LARGER POLITICAL AND SOCIETAL CONTEXT IS OVERLOOKED.
766	IN THE COURSE OF PAKISTAN'S SIXTY-THREE YEARS OF EXISTENCE IT HAS BEEN CALLED "A FAILED STATE," OCCASIONALLY "A FAILING STATE," AND EVEN AT TIMES "A ROGUE STATE." PERHAPS THIS IS A TREND IN CONTEMPORARY COMPARATIVE POLITICS TO LABEL AND CHARACTERIZE THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES WITH SUCH EPITHETS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES AGAINST THESE ASSERTIONS, AND I CONTEND THAT PAKISTAN IS A "STRUGGLING NATION-STATE." THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO OUTLINE A CONCISE DEFINITION OF A STRUGGLING STATE. MY PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IN THIS ARTICLE IS TO EMPHASIZE THE TEMPORAL AND DIRECTIONAL ASPECTS OF A STRUGGLING STATE, PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF PAKISTAN-WHICH IS A NATION STILL IN TRANSITION. IT IS A STATE STILL IN ITS INFANCY (IN SOME MEASURES), EFFECTIVELY STRIVING TO ATTAIN STABILITY IN THE FACE OF AGGRESSION FROM WITHIN THE CONFINES OF ITS BORDERS, AS WELL AS OUTSIDE ITS PERIMETERS. HISTORICALLY PAKISTAN'S DEMOCRATIC TRAJECTORY HAS BEEN INEFFICACIOUS, BUT MORE RECENTLY POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS ARE GAINING A STRONG FOOTHOLD, SPECIFICALLY THE UNWAVERING JUDICIAL BRANCH OF THE COUNTRY WITH ITS SELF-ASSERTIVE CHIEF JUSTICE AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, PUBLIC AWARENESS AND SUPPORT IN REGARDS TO POLITICAL MATTERS. INDEPENDENT JUDICIARIES THAT CAN UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION AGAINST ANY FORM OF COERCION ARE POSITIVE INDICATORS FOR A STATE THAT IS IN ITS DEVELOPMENTAL PHASE AND STRIVING TO DEMOCRATIZE. IN LARRY DIAMOND'S ANALYSIS, CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE FOUNDATIONAL FACTORS BEFORE DEMOCRACY IS INSTITUTED. MOREOVER, HE CONTENDS THAT ENGLAND AND OTHER EUROPEAN STATES HAD CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT AND THE RULE OF LAW PRIOR TO DEMOCRATIZATION.(1)
767	BACKGROUND NATIONAL GOVERNANCE MAY HAVE INFLUENCED THE RESPONSE OF INSTITUTIONS TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, BEING A KEY FACTOR IN PREPARING FOR THE NEXT PANDEMICS. THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO ANALYZE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN EXCESS MORTALITY DUE TO COVID-19 (DAILY AND CUMULATIVE PER 100 THOUSAND PEOPLE) AND NATIONAL GOVERNANCE INDICATORS IN 213 COUNTRIES.METHOD MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS USING SECONDARY DATA FROM LARGE INTERNATIONAL DATASETS THAT ARE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN WERE PERFORMED. GOVERNANCE INDICATORS CORRESPONDED TO SIX DIMENSIONS: (I) VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY; (II) POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE/TERRORISM; (III) GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS; (IV) REGULATORY QUALITY; (V) RULE OF LAW AND (VI) CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS CONSISTED OF ADJUSTING A MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL. EXCESS MORTALITY DUE TO COVID-19 WAS ADJUSTED FOR POTENTIAL CONFOUNDING FACTORS (DEMOGRAPHIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, ECONOMIC, AND ETHNIC VARIABLES).RESULTS THE INDICATORS CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW HAD A SIGNIFICANT INVERSE ASSOCIATION (P < 0.0001) WITH THE ESTIMATED EXCESS MORTALITY IN 2020, 2021 AND 2022. FURTHERMORE, THE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS HAD A DIRECT SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION (P < 0.0001) WITH THE VACCINATION VARIABLES (PEOPLE_FULLY_VACCINATED; DELIVERED POPULATION; THE TOTAL NUMBER OF VACCINATION DOSES ADMINISTERED PER 100 PEOPLE AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL), EXCEPT FOR THE VARIABLES VACCINATION POLICIES AND ADMINISTRATION OF FIRST DOSE, WHICH WERE INVERSELY ASSOCIATED. IN COUNTRIES WITH BETTER GOVERNANCE, COVID-19 VACCINATION WAS INITIATED EARLIER.CONCLUSION BETTER NATIONAL GOVERNANCE INDICATORS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER EXCESS MORTALITY DUE TO COVID-19 AND FASTER ADMINISTRATION OF THE FIRST DOSE OF THE COVID-19 VACCINE.
768	THIS ARTICLE COMPARES THE NEW PRIVATE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED IN THREE TRANSITIONAL (FROM COMMUNISM) CONTEXTS: CENTRAL EUROPE (HUNGARY, POLAND AND SLOVAKIA), THE FORMER SOVIET UNION (ARMENIA, GEORGIA AND UKRAINE) AND ASIA (CHINA). THERE HAVE BEEN MAJOR DIFFERENCES AMONG THESE WORLD REGIONS IN THE CONTEXTS CREATED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ENTERPRISES: IN THE PACE OF CHANGE, THE EXTENT TO WHICH STARE CONTROL AND THE RULE OF LAW HAVE BEEN MAINTAINED OR CREATED, WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN ECONOMIC GROWTH, DECLINE OR STAGNATION, THE DEGREES OF POLITICAL CONTINUITY AND THE LENGTH OF THE COMMUNIST PERIOD. DESPITE THE CONTRASTING CONTEXTS, THERE HAVE BEEN MANY SIMILARITIES IN THE CHARACTERISTICS OF NEW PRIVATE BUSINESSES, BUT ALONGSIDE SOME MAJOR DIFFERENCES: IN THE TYPES OF BUSINESS WITH WHICH BEGINNERS HAVE USUALLY COMMENCED THE MATCH WITH THEIR SPECIALITIES, WHETHER SELF-EMPLOYMENT HAS NORMALLY BEEN A FULL-TIME OR PART-TIME OCCUPATION, WHETHER OR NOT THE STARE HAS BEEN PERCEIVED AS BASICALLY SUPPORTIVE, IN USES OF THE SECOND ECONOMIES AND BRIBERY, AND WHETHER SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP OR PARTNERSHIP HAS BEEN THE NON,TAL INITIAL BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THERE ARE JUST TWO ESSENTIAL CONDITIONS FOR SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION (AS REGARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF SMALL BUSINESS SECTORS): ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE RULE OF LAW. THEREAFTER EVERYTHING SEEMS TO DEPEND ON CREATING A FAVOURABLE CONFIGURATION OF CONDITIONS WHICH, OUR EVIDENCE SUGGESTS, IS MOST LIKELY WHEN COUNTRIES HAVE MAXIMUM SCOPE TO PLOT THEIR OWN TRANSITIONAL ROUTES. IT IS ARGUED THAT IMPOSING ONE ALLEGEDLY CORRECT APPROACH WILL USUALLY BE COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE.
769	THE MULTIANNUAL FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK FOR 2021- 2027 WAS ADOPTED DURING THE SEVERE CRISIS CAUSED BY THE ONGOING CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. IN THE FACE OF A RAPIDLY DETERIORATING ECONOMIC SITUATION, EU COUNTRIES TOOK UNPRECEDENTED STEPS RADICALLY CHANGING THE PRINCIPLES OF RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN THE UNION. THESE INCLUDED THE RECOVERY PLAN FOR EUROPE, MAKING THE EU BUDGET CONDITIONAL ON RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND THE NEW EU RESOURCES SYSTEM. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO IDENTIFY THE ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DECISIONS MADE WITHIN THE MULTIANNUAL FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK AND DEFINE THEIR SIGNIFICANCE FOR ADVANCING INTEGRATION. THE STUDY ATTEMPTS TO ANSWER TWO QUESTIONS: DO THESE DECISIONS MARK THE TRANSITION TO A NEW STAGE OF INTEGRATION AND TO WHAT EXTENT DO THEY COMPLY WITH THE LAW OF THE UNION. SEVERAL EU INITIATIVES RELATED TO DEBT REDISTRIBUTION ARE ANALYSED, ALONG WITH THE IMPACT OF THESE INITIATIVES ON EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY THOSE OF THE BALTIC SEA REGION. THE RESEARCH EXPLORES THE DECISIONS FROM THE STANDPOINT OF LEGAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCE. IN PARTICULAR, IT IS STRESSED THAT, WHEN REACHING A COMPROMISE ON MAKING THE BUDGET CONDITIONAL ON RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW, THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES HAD TO USE A MECHANISM FOR POSTPONING THE EXECUTION OF AN ACT OF THE UNION, WHICH CONTRADICTS THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF EU LAW. FROM A POLITICAL POINT OF VIEW, THE ADOPTION OF A PACKAGE OF LEGISLATIVE ACTS WITHIN THE MULTIANNUAL FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK MEANS GROWING DEPENDENCE OF THE MEMBER STATES AND AN INCREASE IN SOLIDARITY AND LOYALTY WITHIN THE UNION.
770	ISRAELI CONSTITUTIONALISM HAS LONG INTERESTED COMPARATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW SCHOLARS, WHETHER DUE TO ITS GEOPOLITICAL STATUS, THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT, ITS INTERNAL DIVISIONS, OR ITS UNIQUE CONSTITUTIONAL EVOLUTION. UNLIKE MANY OTHER COUNTRIES THAT HAVE RATIFIED CONSTITUTIONS AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR, ISRAEL WAS ESTABLISHED AS A PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY, WITH AN EXPLICIT INTENTION TO RATIFY A CONSTITUTION AT A LATER STAGE. THIS DID NOT HAPPEN. INSTEAD, IT UNDERWENT A "CONSTITUTIONAL REVOLUTION" ANNOUNCED BY ITS SUPREME COURT. FITTING A REVOLUTION, MUCH OF COMPARATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW SCHOLARSHIP HAS FOCUSED ON THIS PIVOTAL MOMENT. THE ARTICLES IN THIS SYMPOSIUM DEPART FROM THE SCHOLARSHIP FOCUSED ON THAT MOMENT. THEY SEEK TO CRITICALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT HAS BECOME OF ISRAELI CONSTITUTIONALISM IN THE PAST DECADE. IN THIS INTRODUCTION, WE HIGHLIGHT SEVERAL TRANSFORMATIONS AND FEATURES WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE ESSENTIAL IF ONE IS TO UNDERSTAND THE EXTANT CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER IN ISRAEL. THESE SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD AS BACKGROUND CONDITIONS AGAINST WHICH ISRAELI CONSTITUTIONALISM IS OPERATING. THEY INCLUDE THE STRENGTHENING OF JUDICIAL REVIEW ALONGSIDE RISING POLITICAL RESISTANCE TO THE COURT'S POWER; POPULISM IN POLITICAL DISCOURSE TARGETING RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS; THE EROSION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS ALONGSIDE THE STRENGTHENING OF NATIONALIST ELEMENTS; AND INCREASING DIVISIONS INSIDE ISRAELI SOCIETY. THESE CHALLENGE THE IDEA OF A SUCCESSFUL CONSTITUTIONAL REVOLUTION IN TERMS OF ITS INHERENT PROMISE TO BETTER PROTECT INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND SAFEGUARD THE RULE OF LAW. IN DESCRIBING THESE FEATURES, WE SEEK TO SITUATE THE SUPREME COURT, JUDICIAL REVIEW, AND THE LEGAL-CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER GENERALLY, IN THE LARGER SPHERE OF ISRAELI SOCIETY AND POLITICS.
771	THROUGH THE LENS OF THE HIGH-PROFILE SPREE KILLING PERPETRATED BY DWIGHT LAMON JONES IN 2018 IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE WAY THE CRIMINAL AND CIVIL COURTS GRAPPLED WITH ASSESSING THE SIGNIFICANCE, EXTENT, AND OUTCOME OF THE IPV AND ABUSE DIRECTED AT DR. CONNIE JONES, DWIGHT JONES'S FORMER WIFE. THE CASE IS UNUSUAL, NOT LEAST BECAUSE DR. JONES HAD AN UPPER MIDDLE-CLASS INCOME AND NUMEROUS RESOURCES IPV VICTIMS DO NOT NORMALLY ENJOY. NEVERTHELESS, SHE FELT THE COURTS LET HER FAMILY DOWN. JOURNALISTS, VICTIM ADVOCATES, AND OTHERS ALSO CRITICIZED THE ARIZONA COURTS. THE ARTICLE OUTLINES THE SPREE KILLING AND THE CRITICISMS OF THE COURTS, NARRATESJONESOVER A PERIOD OF NINE YEARS INCLUDING THE IPV AND MENTAL ILLNESS, AND, THROUGH THE WORK OF THE STUDY COMMITTEE CONVENED BY ARIZONA CHIEF JUSTICE BALES, EXPLORES THE POTENTIAL USE OF IPV RISK ASSESSMENTS IN THE COURTS, PARTICULARLY THE FAMILY COURT, AND RELATED MATTERS. IT CONCLUDES WITH RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING POSSIBLE PREVENTIVE INTERVENTIONS IN IPV CASES, INCLUDING THOSE ADDRESSING MENTAL ILLNESS.
772	THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE IMPACT OF WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ON THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE BIOENERGY INDUSTRY IN SELECTED EUROPEAN COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 1996-2018. APPLYING THE FIXED EFFECT (FE) MODEL, THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT THE BIOENERGY INDUSTRY CAN SIGNIFICANTLY GROW BY IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY IN WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES (WEC). GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY ARE FOUND TO BE INCREASING THE GROWTH OF THE BIOENERGY INDUSTRY. PRECISELY, THE RESULTS FURTHER SHOW THAT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE EFFECT OF GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AND GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) ON BIOENERGY OUTPUT IS HIGHER IN WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES (WEC) AS COMPARED TO THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES (CEEC). ALSO, THE FINDINGS FURTHER ELABORATE THAT THE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT OF REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW ON BIOENERGY OUTPUT IS HIGHER IN CEEC COUNTRIES COMPARED TO THE WEC COUNTRIES. THE FINDING IMPLIES THAT THE GROWTH OF THE BIOENERGY INDUSTRY IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES CAN BE EFFECTIVELY INCREASED BY IMPROVING THE PRACTICE AND QUALITY OF WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS. THE STUDY RECOMMENDS FOR EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE IN THEIR BIOENERGY INDUSTRY TO INCREASE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF BIOENERGY PRODUCTION AND REDUCE DIOXIDE CARBON (CO2) EMISSIONS. POLICYMAKERS IN THESE COUNTRIES SHOULD ALSO INVEST MORE IN WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE TO INCREASE ITS EFFECTIVENESS AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE BIOENERGY INDUSTRY. THE AUTHORITIES SHOULD EQUALLY EMPHASIZE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND TRANSPARENCY OF WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS TO ATTAIN BIOENERGY SECURITY AND LESSEN THE DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUELS.
773	THE GROWTH OF POPULIST NATIONAL FORMS OF GOVERNANCE IN SOME EU MEMBER STATES HAS CAUSED A MARKED DETERIORATION IN THE RESPECT FOR DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE ACTIONS OF THESE ILLIBERAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE LED TO THE CAPTURE OF THOSE INSTI-TUTIONS DESIGNED TO GUARANTEE THE RULE OF LAW, INCLUDING CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS. SOME OF THESE COURTS, MINDFUL OF THE PROTECTION OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND RESPONDING TO THE CJEU'S CASE LAW PROMOTING JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, HAVE REFUSED TO RECOGNISE THE BINDING NATURE ON THEM OF THE RULINGS OF THE CJEU. THE HUNGARIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT (HCC) WAS RECENTLY GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO FOLLOW ITS SISTER COURTS IN GER-MANY, POLAND AND ROMANIA IN THE REFUGEE PUSHBACK CASE BUT REFUSED TO DO SO. THE WORK EXAMINES THE BROADER EU AND MORE SPECIFIC DOMESTIC CONSTITUTIONAL CONTEXTS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE HCC'S CAUTIOUS APPROACH AND AVOIDANCE OF A DIRECT CON-FRONTATION WITH THE CJEU. IT ANALYSES HOW THE HCC, IN EXCEPTIONAL CASES AND IN AN ULTIMA RATIO MANNER, COULD USE THREE TYPES OF CONTROL TO VERIFY, IN THE EXERCISE OF THE COMPETENCES SHARED BETWEEN THE EU AND THE MEMBER STATES, WHETHER IT INFRINGES THE ESSENTIAL CONTENT OF A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT (FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS REVIEW), THE SOVER-EIGNTY OF HUNGARY (SOVEREIGNTY REVIEW OR ULTRA VIRES REVIEW) AS WELL AS ITS CONSTITU-TIONAL IDENTITY (CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY REVIEW). HOWEVER, AT THE SAME TIME, THE HCC BALANCES THE PROTECTION OF THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER WITH THE EU'S DUTY OF SINCERE COOPERATION IN THE FORM OF JUDICIAL DIALOGUE WITH THE CJEU.
774	MOTIVATION: CROSS-COUNTRY GROWTH REGRESSIONS INDICATE THAT INSTITUTIONS ARE IMPORTANT FOR GROWTH. SOME INSTITUTIONS ARE CREATED, PROTECTED AND ENFORCED BY THE GOVERNMENT - THEY ARE THE INSTITUTIONS OF STATE. THE MOST IMPORTANT FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH ARE: ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS, POLITICAL FREEDOM (OR DEMOCRACY), QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE CHANGES THAT TOOK PLACE AFTER 1989 IN THE COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL-EASTERN EUROPE WERE NOT ONLY POLITICAL BUT ALSO ECONOMIC. THE POST-SOCIALIST TRANSITION WAS, ABOVE ALL, A CHANGE OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF STATE. IT WAS A KIND OF THE SO-CALLED 'QUASI-NATURAL EXPERIMENT'. THEREFORE, MY INTENTION IS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION: HOW THE INSTITUTIONS OF STATE AFFECT ECONOMIC GROWTH IN TRANSITION COUNTRIES. AIM: THE AIM IS TO IDENTIFY THE IMPACT STATE INSTITUTIONS HAD ON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN TRANSITION COUNTRIES DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2007-2010. RESULTS: IN THE FIRST PART OF THIS ARTICLE I REVIEW THE LITERATURE AND PRESENT HYPOTHESIS ABOUT DEPENDENCY OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND INSTITUTIONS DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN TRANSITION COUNTRIES. IN THE RELEVANT LITERATURE THERE IS A CONSENSUS THAT WITHOUT AN APPROPRIATE INSTITUTIONAL BACKGROUND, MARKET INCENTIVES DO NOT LEAD TO OPTIMAL RESOURCE ALLOCATION. INSTITUTIONS HAVE A PARTICULARLY CRUCIAL IMPACT IN THE CASE OF POST-SOCIALIST COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE UNDERGONE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TRANSITION. A SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE IS EXERCISED BY SUCH INSTITUTIONS AS: PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AND POLITICAL STABILIZATION, GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY AND RULE OF LAW. THE EXPERIENCES OF TRANSITION COUNTRIES CONFIRM ALSO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM FOR ECONOMIC SITUATION.
775	CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HOLDS THAT THE PERVASIVE UNCERTAINTY IN COPYRIGHT LAW IS INTOLERABLE BECAUSE IT INHIBITS EXPRESSION-THOSE WHO WOULD ENGAGE IN LAWFUL USES OF COPYRIGHTED WORKS ABSTAIN FOR FEAR OF CRUSHING LIABILITY. THE ARGUMENT IS RIGHT BUT FOR THE WRONG REASONS. IT IS BASED ON THE OFTEN-UNSTATED ASSUMPTION THAT USERS WHO FACE LIABILITY ARE RISK AVERSE. BUT THE LEADING ACCOUNT OF DECISION MAKING UNDER UNCERTAINTY SUGGESTS THAT THOSE FACING POTENTIAL LOSSES ARE IN FACT RISK SEEKING, WHILE THOSE FACING POTENTIAL GAINS ARE RISK AVERSE. IN LIGHT OF THIS ASYMMETRY IN RISK PREFERENCES, COPYRIGHT'S ASYMMETRIC DISTRIBUTION OF UNCERTAINTY-SALIENT ISSUES FOR USERS ARE OPAQUE WHILE THOSE FOR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS ARE CLEAR-PROMOTES ACCESS WHILE PRESERVING COPYRIGHT HOLDER INCENTIVES. USERS DISCOUNT THE RISKS OF BOUNDARY CROSSING BECAUSE THE DOCTRINES OF ACCESS MAKE THE BOUNDARIES UNPREDICTABLE, AND COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OVERVALUE THEIR ENTITLEMENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE RELIABLE, PROTECTING AGAINST THE MOST FEARED USES OF THEIR WORKS WITH PREDICTABLY POTENT REMEDIES. IN SHORT, THE SYSTEM EXPLOITS ASYMMETRIC RISK PREFERENCES THROUGH ITS ASYMMETRIC DISTRIBUTION OF UNCERTAINTY. GOOD ECONOMICS DOES NOT ALWAYS MAKE GOOD LAW, HOWEVER. THE RULE OF LAW IDEAL ALSO VALUES CLARITY IN AN ASYMMETRIC WAY: THE NEED FOR NOTICE IS AT ITS ZENITH WHERE THE LAW IMPOSES PUNISHMENT AND ITS NADIR WHERE THE LAW CONFERS BENEFITS. EVEN IF IT IS TRUE THAT COPYRIGHT'S ASYMMETRIC UNCERTAINTY PROMOTES MAXIMAL EXPRESSION, FORCING USERS TO SHOULDER THE BURDENS OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE NAME OF SOCIAL WELFARE EVINCES A DISRESPECT FOR USER AUTONOMY THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE RULE OF LAW.
776	RULES AND NORMS OF BEHAVIOUR ARE COMMON FEATURES IN HUMAN SOCIETY. THIS IS CONFIRMED BY HUMAN BEING'S DESIRE FOR PROTECTION, FAIRNESS AND MUTUAL RESPECT FROM FELLOW HUMANS IN THEIR SOCIAL GROUPS. RECOGNIZED AUTHORITIES WHOSE SANCTIONS ARE RESPECTED HELP TO ENSURE FAIRNESS AND MUTUAL RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER. FOR THE TRADITIONAL BENIN (AFRICAN) SOCIETY, THE ISSUE OF LAW AND JUSTICE IS THE JOINT CONCERN OF THE DEITIES, ANCESTORS AND THE HUMAN MEMBERS WITHIN THE SOCIETY. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER, IS TO EXAMINE (I) THE RELEVANCE OF TRADITIONAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN POSTCOLONIAL BENIN (AFRICAN) SOCIETY; AND (II) THE UNWAVERING RESPECT FOR TRADITIONAL VALUES WHICH THE BENIN (AFRICAN) PEOPLE HAVE MAINTAINED EVEN IN A POSTCOLONIAL ERA; AND ARGUE THAT THE CONTINUAL PREFERENCE FOR TRADITIONAL METHODS OF OBTAINING JUSTICE BY THE PEOPLE OF BENIN (AFRICA) ARE NOT UNCONNECTED WITH THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF THE RECEIVED ENGLISH LEGAL SYSTEM WITHIN AN AFRICAN TERRAIN. AS INSIDERS, WE PROPOSE A HARMONIZATION OF A `EURO-AFRO-CENTRIC JUDICIAL SYSTEM, FOR WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD BE BENEFICIAL AND PROGRESSIVE FOR US AS A PEOPLE IN QUEST FOR JUSTICE IN A POSTCOLONIAL BENIN (AFRICAN) SOCIETY.
777	THIS PAPER ANALYSES SOME HERMENEUTIC PRINCIPLES WHOSE NORMATIVE SCOPE DEFINES THE RATIONAL EXERCISE OF MANDATORY RELATIONSHIPS AND, AS A CONSEQUENCE, CONTRACTUAL AND EXTRACONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS. THIS ANALYSIS IS BUILT FROM A CONSTITUTIONAL VIEW OF PRIVATE LAW, WHICH EMPHASIZES IN POSTULATES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND SOCIAL LAW STATE AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW ON REGULATION OF ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS. IN A CONTEXT OF RATIONAL USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES, THOSE PRINCIPLES CONSTITUTE THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE BALANCE AND EQUITY IN ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS, BY PREVENTING EXCESSES OF STRONG ECONOMIC GROUPS -OR THOSE CONTRACTUAL SUBJECTS IN A DOMINANT POSITION- AND FAVORING THE PROTECTION OF CONSUMER RIGHTS ALONG THE BUSINESS CYCLE.
778	THIS STUDY OFFERS A DISCUSSION OF THE DANGERS TO THE STABILITY OF POLITICAL SYSTEMS IN CONSOLIDATED DEMOCRACIES POSED BY CONTEMPORARY POPULISM, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE DYNAMIC DEVELOPMENT OF EXTREME RIGHT-WING POPULISM. THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS THE CONSEQUENCES OF EFFICIENT POPULIST CAMPAIGNS, SUCH AS BREXIT IN GREAT BRITAIN, LOWERED TRUST TOWARDS THE UNITED STATES UNDER TRUMP'S ADMINISTRATION AND PRACTICES FOLLOWED BY THE LAW AND JUSTICE PARTY (PIS) UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF JAROSLAW KACZYNSKI IN POLAND, WHICH SEEM ESPECIALLY DESTRUCTIVE FOR LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. FURTHER EXAMPLES ARE THOSE OF HUNGARY AND TURKEY, WHERE THE POLITICAL SYSTEMS HAVE ERODED INTO SEMI-CONSOLIDATED DEMOCRACY IN THE CASE OF THE FORMER AND AN AUTHORITARIAN SYSTEM IN THE LATTER CASE. A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF FREEDOM INDICES INDICATES SOME DANGERS RELATED TO DE-CONSOLIDATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM IN POLAND. FURTHERMORE, THE STUDY POINTS OUT DANGERS ARISING FROM THE TRANSFORMATION OF SOFT POPULISM, UNDERSTOOD AS COMMUNICATION RHETORIC ORIENTED TOWARDS THE CONCENTRATION OF POWER IN THE HANDS OF POPULIST LEADERS, WHICH CLEARLY PAVES THE WAY FOR THE DISMANTLING OF CONSOLIDATED DEMOCRACY IN FAVOUR OF AN AUTHORITARIAN SYSTEM. THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE STUDY OUTLINES A VARIETY OF ACTIONS WHICH CAN BE UNDERTAKEN TO PROTECT THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY.
779	THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON A FIGURE ARCHIVED IN CONTEMPORARY AUSTRALIAN LAW, A FIGURE WHO IS CENTRAL TO THE STATE'S CONTROL OF ABORIGINAL PEOPLE. THIS FIGURE, LIKE HER COUNTERPARTS IN EARLIER HISTORICAL PERIODS, IS TO BE FOUND IN LEGISLATION AND IN CASE LAW, AND IN LAW'S SUPPLEMENTARY GENRES, INCLUDING WELFARE AND INDIGENOUS POLICY, AND PARLIAMENTARY SECOND-READING SPEECHES. THIS FIGURE IS THE `ABUSED ABORIGINAL CHILD', AND SHE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT TO THE PRODUCTION OF MYTHS OF THE AUSTRALIAN NATION-STATE, AND TO THE RULE OF LAW. SHE IS BEING USED TO JUSTIFY THE CONTINUED ADMINISTRATION OF ABORIGINAL COMMUNITIES, THROUGH SIMULTANEOUSLY THE CONTINUING SUSPENSION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE VIOLENT INSTRUMENTALISATION OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ARCHIVE OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY INTERVENTION AND SUBSEQUENT STRONGER FUTURES LEGISLATION, INVESTIGATING THE WAYS IN WHICH LAW'S VIOLENCE MASQUERADES AS LAW'S CARE. I SEEK TO EXPLORE THE WAYS IN WHICH READING LAW AS AN ARCHIVE OPENS UP THE POSSIBILITY OF A COUNTER-ARCHIVAL PRACTICE THAT INTERRUPTS AND DISORIENTS LAW'S CLAIM TO VIOLENT JURISDICTION OVER ABORIGINAL PEOPLE. THE EMPHASIS HERE IS ON READING LAW AS ARCHIVE -ON TAKING UP A POSITION OF READERLY RESPONSIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE PRACTICES OF REPRESENTATION THAT CONSTITUTE LAW'S ARCHIVE, AND ON CONSTRUCTING COUNTER-ARCHIVAL PRACTICES AND IMAGINARIES THAT RESIST AND RE-SITUATE LAW'S AUTHORITY. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, I EXAMINE ALEXIS WRIGHT'S MOST RECENT NOVEL, THE SWAN BOOK (2013), WHICH IS READ AS AN EXEMPLARY COUNTER-ARCHIVAL TEXT THAT INTERRUPTS LAW'S ARCHIVAL PRACTICES AND CLAIMS.
780	THIS WORK CONTENDS THAT LATIN AMERICA HAS LAUNCHED A TRUE REVOLUTION ON COLLECTIVE RIGHTS: MOVING BEYOND THE PARADIGM OF GROUP ENTITLEMENTS, WHICH CONCERN A DETERMINATE-THOUGH. POTENTIALLY ENORMOUS-COLLECTIVITY, TO THAT OF COMPREHENSIVE ENTITLEMENTS, WHICH GENERALLY PERTAIN TO SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. LATIN AMERICAN JURISDICTIONS HAVE CREATED INNOVATIVE PROCEDURAL MECHANISMS IN THIS AREA: THE COLLECTIVE WRIT OF PROTECTION,FOR THE REALIZATION OF GROUP RIGHTS, THE POPULAR ACTION FOR THE CIVIC VINDICATION OF COMPREHENSIVE ENTITLEMENTS, AND THE PUBLIC CIVIL ACTION FOR THE OFFICIAL ENFORCEMENT OF BOTH KINDS OF RIGHTS. THE U.S. LEGAL ORDER HAS MUCH TO LEARN FROM A COMPARATIVE REFLECTION UPON THESE DEVELOPMENTS. IT COULD, ACCORDINGLY, OPEN TIP TO THE CREATION OF A UNIVERSALLY AVAILABLE CITIZEN'S SUIT, THE INSTITUTION OF AN AUTONOMOUS STATE BODY WITH POWER TO FILE COMPLAINTS ON BEHALF OF COMMUNAL AND SOCIETAL INTERESTS, THE CONCESSION OF STANDING TO ORGANIZATIONS (AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS) TO PURSUE CLASS SUITS, AND THE INTRODUCTION OF A SINGLE, STRAIGHTFORWARD CLASSIFICATION UNDER RULE 23(B) OF THE FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY CALLING ATTENTION TO THE TENSION BETWEEN LATIN AMERICAN EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT TRANS-INDIVIDUAL GUARANTIES AND THE SPORADIC PRECARIOUSNESS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE REGION. IT ARGUES THAT, BEYOND, ADOPTING NEW MEASURES OR PUNISHING VIOLATORS MORE SEVERELY, THE COUNTRIES AFFECTED MUST BROADLY ENHANCE THE LEGITIMACY OF LEGAL NORMS BY RENEWING THEIR COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY, AS WELL AS TO OTHER IDEALS, SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW ITSELF, PERSONAL FREEDOM, AND (ABOVE ALL) SOLIDARITY.
781	THIRTY YEARS AFTER THE DECLARATION OF ITS INDEPENDENCE, UKRAINE, UNFORTUNATELY, HAS NOT YET MANAGED TO MODERNIZE ITS LEGAL SYSTEM TO A LEVEL OF PROPER EFFICIENCY. THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO THE DICHOTOMY OF THE PREVIOUS INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY OF OUR STATE BETWEEN THE TWO VECTORS OF DEVELOPMENT, THE OLD EASTERN AND THE NEW WESTERN ONE, WHICH ACTUALLY RETARDED THE MOVEMENT FORWARD. THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN THESE VIEWS ON THE PROSPECTS OF UKRAINE'S DEVELOPMENT OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION AND THE GENERATION THAT CONTINUED TO CARRY THE MEMORY OF ITS HISTORICAL PAST, WAS NO LESS SIGNIFICANT. CORRUPTION IS DEEPLY ROOTED IN THE SYSTEM OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND WAS PURPOSEFULLY SUPPORTED BY INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OPPONENTS OF UKRAINE'S INDEPENDENCE AND OVERCOMING THESE RELICS IS A FUNDAMENTAL TASK IN ASSERTING SOVEREIGNTY. REMNANTS OF THE POST-SOVIET LEGAL DOCTRINE, WHICH PRESERVE THE DEFINING CATEGORIES OF JUDICIAL LAW IN AN OSSIFIED FORM, SUCH AS 'COURT', 'JUDICIARY', 'JUSTICE', HAVE BECOME A SERIOUS OBSTACLE TO THE FORMATION OF THE NEW STATE AND ITS LEGAL SYSTEM. THIS SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITS THE ABILITY TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE LEGAL REGULATION OF RELATIONS CONNECTED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN THE STATE. AN OVERVIEW OF THE THEORETICAL AND NORMATIVE FOUNDATIONS THAT UNDERLIE THE UKRAINIAN JUDICIARY AND THE JUSTICE SYSTEM POINTS TO OBVIOUS GAPS AND INCONSISTENCIES. IT IS INDISPUTABLE THAT THE MODERNIZATION OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF UKRAINE, IN PARTICULAR, IN THE SPHERE OF THE ORGANIZATION OF THE JUDICIARY, REQUIRES A RENEWED SCIENTIFIC VISION BASED ON THE DOCTRINE OF JUDICIAL LAW AND WHICH SHOULD ATTEMPT TO COMBINE UKRAINIAN TRADITIONS AND THE WESTERN EUROPEAN VIEWPOINT.
782	DOGMATIC AS "SCIENCE OF LAW" HAS AS A FOUNDING BASIS THE NEED TO IDENTIFY INSTITUTIONS OF LAW, FROM A CONCEPTUAL SOURCE OF DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITIES. CRIMINAL LAW AND DISCIPLINARY LAW ARE TWO SPECIES, AMONG OTHERS, OF SANCTIONING LAW OR IUS PUNIENDI OF THE STATE. THIS WORK SHOWS THE EXISTING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM FROM A "GENDER-SPECIE" POINT OF VIEW, OF COURSE CONSIDERING AS WELL THE POLITICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL-POLITICAL CRITERIA IN ORDER TO SHOW THE WHOLE SCENARIO OF THIS DISCIPLINE IN COLOMBIA.
783	ENTREPRENEURSHIP CAN BE FULFILLING AND ENHANCE WELLBEING, BUT ALSO HIGHLY STRESSFUL AND DIMINISH WELLBEING. THIS META-ANALYTICAL REVIEW SYNTHESIZES 319 EFFECT SIZES FROM 94 STUDIES AND 82 COUNTRIES TO ESTABLISH WHETHER INDIVIDUALS DERIVE GREATER WELLBEING FROM WORKING FOR THEMSELVES OR FOR SOMEONE ELSE. THE ANSWER IS PARTLY POSITIVE IN FAVOR OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP BUT DEPENDS ON THE COMPONENTS OF WELLBEING UNDER INVESTIGATION (POSITIVE WELLBEING OR NEGATIVE WELLBEING/MENTAL ILLBEING) AND THE INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT (ESPECIALLY THE RULE OF LAW). WE CONTRIBUTE BY DEVELOPING THE COMPONENT VIEW OF WELLBEING AS AN ORGANIZING FRAMEWORK AND BY ADVANCING AN INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE TO GUIDE RESEARCH ON ENTREPRENEURS' WELLBEING.
784	DEMOCRACY IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RULERS AND THE GOVERNED ONES, THE PROCESS OF CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE ITSELF IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RULERS AND THE GOVERNED ONES. CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES ARE OR SHOULD BE IN THE SERVICE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER, IN THE SERVICE OF DEMOCRACY, IN THE SERVICE OF THE RULE OF LAW, IN THE SERVICE OF THE PEOPLE. UNDER THE WORD DEMOCRACY, UNDER THE SLOGAN FOR THE PEOPLE/WITH THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN MADE CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES THAT DO NOT REPRESENT THE PEOPLE, THAT DO NOT REPRESENT THE VALUES THAT A NATION HOLDS/GRIPS, CHANGES THAT ARE NOT LEGITIMATE, THAT REPRESENTED HIDDEN POLITICAL INTERESTS.
785	THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH PUBLIC POLICIES AS A MEANS FOR THE STATE TO RESPECT, PROTECT, GUARANTEE AND PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS, THROUGH PLANS, PROGRAMS, PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES, IN WHOSE TRAINING PROCESS THE PARTICIPATION OF THE SOCIETY IS FUNDAMENTAL. UNDER THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE SOCIAL RULE OF LAW, WHOSE BUDGET (PRESUPUESTO) IS HUMAN DIGNITY, THE FORMATION OF PUBLIC POLICIES WITH MORE RELEVANCE SHOULD BE ORIENTED TO THE EMBODIMENT OF RIGHTS, A PROCESS FOR WHICH THE RIGHTS-BASED APPROACH IS QUITE USEFUL, WHOSE ELEMENTS ARE SPECIFIED IN THE DELIMITATION OF THE LAW, THE LIABILITIES OF THE STATE AND THE CROSS-CUTTING PRINCIPLES.
786	THE QUESTION OF WHETHER A MOTHER SHOULD BE LIABLE FOR HARM INFLICTED UPON HER UNBORN CHILD, GARNERS HEATED DEBATE OVER MORALITY, ETHICS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE EVER EVOLVING SCOPE OF THE DUTY OF CARE RELATIONSHIP AND THE ABOLITION OF INTER-FAMILIAL IMMUNITY, PRECIPITATE THE ARGUMENT THAT A PREGNANT WOMAN'S MATERNAL DUTY OF CARE TO HER UNBORN CHILD IS A REASONABLE PROGRESSION IN THE LAW OF TORTS. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO EXPLORE A MOTHER'S TORTIOUS LIABILITY TOWARDS AN UNBORN CHILD AND THE VARIOUS POLICY ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST IMPOSING SUCH A DUTY OF CARE.
787	COUNTER-TERRORISM MEASURES MUST BE DEVELOPED THAT ARE BOTH EFFECTIVE AND MEET ACCOUNTABILITY STANDARDS. THIS ARTICLE APPROACHES THE ISSUE BY: (1) PROPOSING A MATRIX FACILITATING THE MEASUREMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OR INEFFECTIVENESS OF A PARTICULAR COUNTER-TERRORISM MEASURE; AND (2) PROPOSING AN ACCOUNTABILITY MATRIX FOR MEASURING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PARTICULAR MEASURES. THE ARTICLE'S CENTRAL FOCUS IS ON DEVELOPING CRITERIA FOR MEASURING EFFECTIVE COUNTER-TERRORISM - PREMISED ON THE RULE OF LAW, POLICY CONSIDERATIONS AND THE LIMITS OF POWER. IF UTILISED, THESE CRITERIA WILL PROVIDE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT PARTICULAR COUNTER-TERRORISM MEASURES IN ACTUALITY CONTRIBUTE TO EFFECTIVE AND LEGAL COUNTER-TERRORISM.
788	POLITICAL SCIENTISTS REGULARLY JUSTIFY PARTICULAR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES TWO DESIDERATA FOR SUCH JUSTIFICATIONS. THE FIRST IS A FORMAL EQUALITY BASELINE WHICH PUTS THE BURDEN OF JUSTIFICATION ON THOSE WHO FAVOUR MORE UNEQUAL INSTITUTIONS. THIS BASELINE IS SEEN AS AN IMPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE SECOND DESIDERATUM, THE COMPARISON REQUIREMENT, BUILDS ON THE FIRST: ADEQUATE JUSTIFICATIONS OF PARTICULAR INSTITUTIONS MUST COMPARE THEM TO THE BEST ALTERNATIVE, AND THIS COMPARISON MUST CONSIDER THE COSTS FOR POLITICAL EQUALITY. THE TWO DESIDERATA ARE APPLIED TO POLITICAL SCIENCE DEBATES ABOUT THE PROPORTIONALITY OF THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM AND BICAMERAL SYSTEMS OF LEGISLATIVE DECISION-MAKING.
789	THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO SHOW THAT THE LEGAL PROTECTION OF CHILDREN MUST BE RECOGNISED AS A PRIORITY. THE MORAL RIGHTS OF CHILDREN ARE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS WITH DIFFERENT DEGREES OF GENERALITY. THEY NOT ONLY REFLECT THE FACT THAT CHILDREN MERIT JUSTICE, BUT ARE ALSO INDISPENSABLE FOR THE PROMOTION OF JUSTICE IN SOCIETY IN GENERAL, THUS ALLOWING OTHER RIGHTS, INCLUDING THOSE OF ADULTS, TO BE SAFEGUARDED APPROPRIATELY. THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS ROLE IN REDUCING VIOLENCE GO HAND IN HAND WITH PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM HARM. A CHILDHOOD THAT IS FREE OF VIOLENCE IS AN ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITE OF A JUST SOCIETY.
790	THE POLICE HAS PLAYED A MINOR ROLE IN NORWEGIAN POLITICAL HISTORY WRITING. IN THE ARTICLE I ARGUE THAT STUDIES OF THE POLITICS OF THE POLICE CAN PROVIDE NEW INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IDEOLOGIES WERE AT PLAY DURING THE FIRST DECADES OF THE CIVIL-SERVANT STATE. BASED ON ANALYSES OF HOW THE POLICE WAS DISCUSSED IN PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES, IN BOOKS AND IN NEWSPAPERS, I CLAIM THAT THE POLITICAL DEBATE ON THE POLICE IN THE PERIOD 1814-1842 WAS CHARACTERIZED BY TWO COMPETING IDEOLOGIES: A BUREAUCRATIC IDEOLOGY WITH EMPHASIS ON THE "RULE OF LAW", AND A REPUBLICAN IDEOLOGY WITH EMPHASIS ON CLASSIC CIVIC IDEALS.
791	THE BERNANKE FED CONTINUES THE LONG HISTORY OF US MONETARY INSTITUTIONS BEING USED AS TOOLS FOR ENHANCING THE RESOURCES AND POWER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HISTORICALLY, INFLATION HAS BEEN THE MOST COMMON WAY OF CONDUCTING THIS TRANSFER OF RESOURCES FROM THE PUBLIC TO THE STATE. VARIOUS REGULATORY INTERVENTIONS HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THE TASK AS WELL. WHAT DIFFERENTIATES THE BERNANKE FED IS THAT IT HAS USED POWERS OBTAINED DURING A CRISIS TO UNDERTAKE POLICIES THAT HAVE REDISTRIBUTED WEALTH DIRECTLY TO BANKS AND LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE GUISE OF MONETARY POLICY, AND IT HAS DONE SO IN WAYS THAT UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW.
792	MODERN WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS (WDSS) ARE OFTEN CONTROLLED BY SUPERVISORY CONTROL AND DATA ACQUISITION (SCADA) SYSTEMS AND PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC CONTROLLERS (PLCS) WHICH MANAGE THEIR OPERATION AND MAINTAIN A RELIABLE WATER SUPPLY. AS SUCH, AND WITH THE CYBER LAYER BECOMING A CENTRAL COMPONENT OF WDS OPERATIONS, THESE SYSTEMS ARE AT A GREATER RISK OF BEING SUBJECTED TO CYBERATTACKS. THIS PAPER OFFERS A MODEL-BASED METHODOLOGY BASED ON A DETAILED HYDRAULIC UNDERSTANDING OF WDSS COMBINED WITH AN ANOMALY DETECTION ALGORITHM FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF COMPLEX CYBERATTACKS THAT CANNOT BE FULLY IDENTIFIED BY HYDRAULICALLY BASED RULES ALONE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM IS CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING THE BEST-KNOWN PERFORMANCE WHEN TESTED ON THE DATA PUBLISHED IN THE BATTLE OF THE ATTACK DETECTION ALGORITHMS (BATADAL) COMPETITION (HTTP://WWW.BATADAL.NET).

793	FROM A CRITIQUE OF THE ORIGINAL DEFINITION OF POSITIVE DUTIES, BY THEIR TENDENCY TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE CATEGORY OF SOLIDARITY, THE ESSAY REVIEWS A SERIES OF PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACHES IN ORDER TO PROPOSE A DIFFERENTIATION INTERNAL TO THE PRINCIPLE OF SOLIDARITY. THIS INQUIRY, WHICH STARTS AT THE SAME TIME FROM THE PREMISE OF AN ASYMMETRY BETWEEN FREEDOM AND SOLIDARITY IN A LIBERAL RULE OF LAW, WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN, ON THE ONE HAND, THE GENERAL DUTY OF RESCUE AND, ON THE OTHER, THE DUTIES OF SOLIDARITY OF THE CITIZEN IN RELATION TO THE STATE.
794	DURING THE LAST 20 YEARS OMBUDSMEN HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN MOST LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE HOW THESE INSTITUTIONS HAVE EVOLVED IN SIX COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THEIR POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE AND STRENGTH. IN SPITE OF THE POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT ROLE THAT SUCH INSTITUTIONS MAY HAVE IN PROMOTING PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY, RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW IN NEW DEMOCRACIES, SOME OMBUDSMEN HAVE BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN OTHERS IN THESE TASKS. THIS ARTICLE REFLECTS ON POSSIBLE FACTORS ACCOUNTING FOR THE RELATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE OMBUDSMAN, AND DISCUSSES THE ROLE THAT THIS INSTITUTION PLAYS IN CONTEMPORARY LATIN AMERICA.
795	THE CIA INTERVENED REGULARLY IN LATIN AMERICA POLITICS DURING THE COLD WAR, IN SOME CASES GOING AS FAR AS BRINGING ABOUT REGIME CHANGE. WE STUDY THE ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND CIVIL SOCIETY EFFECTS OF CIA-SPONSORED REGIME CHANGE IN FIVE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND FIND THAT THESE ACTIONS CAUSED MODERATE DECLINES IN REAL PER-CAPITA INCOME AND LARGE DECLINES IN DEMOCRACY SCORES, RULE OF LAW, FREEDOM OF SPEECH, AND CIVIL LIBERTIES. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT ANY BENEFITS TO COME OUT OF THESE INTERVENTIONS SHOULD BE WEIGHED AGAINST THE LARGE COSTS THAT WERE IMPOSED ON THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THESE COUNTRIES.
796	WE STUDY A DYNAMIC MODEL OF PROPERTY APPROPRIATION IN AUTOCRACIES. TO MAINTAIN THE APPEARANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW, AN AUTOCRAT REASSIGNS PROPERTY ONLY WHEN THE REASSIGNMENT IS ACCEPTABLE TO ALL AFFECTED CITIZENS. NEVERTHELESS, THE AUTOCRAT CAN APPROPRIATE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROPERTY BY EXPLOITING ENFORCEMENT GAPS. AFTER AN ADJUSTMENT PERIOD, WEALTH SHARES OF PUBLIC PROPERTY AND THE PRIVATE PROPERTY OF OUT-GROUPS DECLINE. THE MODEL RATIONALIZES THE CONNECTION BETWEEN WEALTH INEQUALITY AND PRIVATIZATION IN MANY AUTOCRACIES. CALIBRATING TO RUSSIAN AND CHINESE DATA, SIMULATIONS TO MID-TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY DISPLAY WIDENING WEALTH GAPS BETWEEN ELITES AND THE POPULACE. ANOCRACIES MITIGATE THIS OUTCOME.
797	RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTS OF NATIONAL CULTURES AND THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH THE REGULATORY INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT ON DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION IN EMERGING ECONOMIES CONTEXT REMAINS SCARCE. THUS, TO ANSWER THIS GAP, WE DRAW FROM THE SOCIOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK OF INSTITUTIONAL ANOMIE THEORY AND HYPOTHESIZED THAT DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION IS A FORM OF POSITIVE DEVIANCE TO ANOMIC CONDITIONS IN SOCIETIES. USING MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS, THE RESULTS SHOWED SUPPORT FOR MODERATING EFFECTS OF THE REGULATORY INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT, I.E., RULE OF LAW AND REGULATORY QUALITY ON THE CULTURAL DRIVERS AND DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION RELATIONSHIPS. FINALLY, WE DISCUSS THE RESULTS, THE STUDY'S CONTRIBUTIONS AND CONCLUDE WITH LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH.
798	THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE (GBV) AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GBV AND THE INTERNATIONAL ARMS TRADE. IT EXAMINES HOW GOVERNMENTS AND ACTIVISTS WORKED TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT THE ARMS TRADE TREATY INCLUDED A LEGALLY BINDING PROVISION TO PREVENT GBV, AND HOW THIS PROVISION HAS BEEN USED-OR NOT USED-SINCE THE TREATY'S ADOPTION IN 2013. IT ALSO ENCOURAGES STATES, ARMS PRODUCERS, LAWYERS, AND ACTIVISTS TO WORK TO ENSURE THAT HUMAN LIVES AND WELLBEING ARE PRIORITISED OVER PROFITS AS AN IMPERATIVE TO REALISING THE ATT'S OBJECTIVE AND PURPOSE, AND TO ENSURING RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND INTERNATIONAL LAW.
799	THE INSTITUTION OF THE OMBUDSMAN IS AIMED AT DEFENDING VALUES SUCH AS HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AGAINST ANY FORM OF ABUSE OR ARBITRARINESS. MANY ACADEMIC STUDIES HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE OMBUDSMAN IN ITS DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENTS AROUND THE WORLD, BUT NOT TO THE MAGHREB AREA. THIS ARTICLE WANTS TO SHED LIGHT ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OMBUDSMAN IN ALGERIA, MAURITANIA, MOROCCO AND TUNISIA. THE COMPARATIVE EXAM OF THE DIFFERENT NORTH AFRICAN OMBUDSMEN WILL POINT OUT HOW THE INSTITUTION WAS ABLE TO SURVIVE ONLY IN STATES WHERE A TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY WAS TRULY IN PLACE.
800	THE CONTINUOUS INTERACTION BETWEEN INTELLIGENT DEVICES, SENSORS AND PEOPLE POINTS TO THE INCREASING NUMBER OF DATA BEING PRODUCED, STORED AND PROCESSED, CHANGING, IN VARIOUS ASPECTS AND INCREASINGLY, OUR DAILY LIFE. THIS INCREASING CONNECTIVITY AND SYMBIOTIC INTERACTION AMONG HUMANS AND INTELLIGENT MACHINES BRINGS SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND CONTEMPORARY ETHICS. DO MACHINES HAVE MORALITY? WHAT LEGAL LIABILITY REGIME SHOULD WE ADOPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM INCREASINGLY ADVANCED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE? WHICH ETHICAL GUIDELINE SHOULD WE ADOPT TO ORIENT ITS ADVANCEMENT? IN THIS PAPER WE WILL DISCUSS THE MAIN NORMATIVE AND ETHICAL CHALLENGES IMPOSED BY THE ADVANCEMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.
801	IN THIS PAPER WE INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL CAPITAL AND CHEATING BEHAVIOUR IN STANDARDIZED TESTS. GIVEN THE LOW-STAKES NATURE OF THESE TESTS, WE INTERPRET THE WIDESPREAD PRESENCE OF CHEATING AS A SIGNAL OF LOW TRUST TOWARDS CENTRAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES AND AS LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW. WE FIND THAT CHEATING IS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED TO SEVERAL SOCIAL CAPITAL PROXIES IN THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT WHERE A SCHOOL IS LOCATED. WE ALSO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF SOCIAL CAPITAL: CONTRASTING UNIVERSALISTIC AND PARTICULARISTIC SOCIAL VALUES, CHEATING APPEARS TO BE NEGATIVELY CORRELATED ONLY TO MEASURES OF UNIVERSALISTIC SOCIAL VALUES.
802	RECOGNIZED THE PARTICULAR AUTONOMY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES THAT SHOULD BE EXPOSED ACCORDING TO THE EXTENT OF THEIR LEGITIMACY. THROUGHOUT THIS WORK, WE DEVELOP THE NECESSITY TO PROVIDE THESE AUTHORITIES WITH THE POWER TO QUALIFY A CERTAIN ACTIVITY AS A PUBLIC SERVICE, AND THE SUBSEQUENT SELECTION OF A MANAGEMENT MODEL (ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL) TO SATISFY THEM. AS WELL AS THE APPARENT CONTRA-DICTION BETWEEN THIS CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE OF SELF-ORGANIZATION POWER AND THE TYPICAL CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE (UNDERSTOOD AS A RESULT OF THE RULE OF LAW), BOTH AS A RESULT OF THE ARRANGEMENT OF COMPETENCIES BETWEEN THE LEGISLATIVE POWER AND THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
803	WHILE COLONIALISM, IN GENERAL, IS A CONTESTED CONCEPT, AS ARE THE CONDITIONS THAT CONSTITUTE ITS NEGATION, POLITICAL DECOLONISATION SEEMS TO BE A RELATIVELY SETTLED ARGUMENT. WHERE SUCH DECOLONISATION OCCURRED, POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE, AND ITS ATTENDANT DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM AND THE UNDERGIRDING OF THE RULE OF LAW, SIGNIFY THE SELF-EVIDENTIALITY OF SUCH POLITICAL DECOLONISATION. THIS ARTICLE RETHINKS THIS SELF-EVIDENTIALITY OF POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE AS NECESSARILY A DECOLONIAL POLITICAL ACCOMPLISHMENT IN GHANA. THIS CRITICAL ENTERPRISE OPENS THE DOCUMENTS THAT FOUNDED THE NEWLY INDEPENDENT STATE TO ALTERNATIVE READING TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THE COLONIAL FOLDED ITSELF INTO THE DICTATE OF FREEDOM.
804	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ROLE OF REFORM IN MAINTAINING ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WORK-AGE IS DECLINING MORE RAPIDLY THAN TOTAL POPULATION. TRADITIONAL FACTOR-DRIVEN GROWTH CAN STILL CONTRIBUTE IF REFORM INCREASES LABOUR FORCE PARTICIPATION, MOST SIGNIFICANTLY THROUGH EASING RESTRICTIONS ON RURAL-URBAN MIGRATION THROUGH REFORM OF THE HOUSEHOLD REGISTRATION SYSTEM AND OTHER MEANS. THE OTHER POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTOR TO GROWTH IN THE NEW ERA IS REFORM TO RAISE PRODUCTIVITY. THIS REQUIRES MORE FUNDAMENTAL INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE, WHICH DEPENDS ON CLEAR VISIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK FOR A MODERN MARKET ECONOMY, ENCOMPASSING THE RULE OF LAW AND STRONGER PROPERTY RIGHTS.
805	CAN THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN UNITY INTO THE AFRICAN UNION AND THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW PARTNERSHIP FOR AFRICA'S DEVELOPMENT (NEPAD) REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS ON THE AFRICAN CONTINENT? THIS ARTICLE SETS OUT THE COMMITMENTS OF THE NEW AFRICAN CONTINENTAL INSTRUMENTS IN RELATION TO DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW AND CONCLUDES THAT THEY ARE USEFUL AND IMPORTANT-BUT ALSO THAT NEPAD IN PARTICULAR HAS SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES. THE SECOND HALF OF THE ARTICLE SETS OUT FIVE THEMES THAT SHOULD RECEIVE GREATER ATTENTION IF TRUE EFFORT IS TO BE MADE TO ADDRESS AFRICA'S PROBLEMS.
806	CHINA'S WESTERN DEVELOPMENT POLICY REDEFINES THE SICHUAN FRONTIER AS BACKWARD ECONOMIC HINTERLAND, AND AS ECOLOGICAL BUFFER ZONE FOR THE COAST. STATE PLANNERS SEE THE 'FARMLAND TO FOREST' PLAN AND HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT AS ACHIEVING SOCIALIST MODERNISATION THROUGH ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING. LOCAL PEOPLE LIKE THE REFORESTATION PLAN THAT MAINTAINS SUBSISTENCE ON THE LAND, BUT THEY PROTEST LAND EXPROPRIATION THAT ACCOMPANIES DAM CONSTRUCTION. IN NEGOTIATING THE TERMS OF THIS NEW NATIONAL INTEGRATION, PROTESTERS DRAW ON BOTH HISTORICAL MEMORY AND A NEW DISCOURSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW TO ASSERT 'POPULAR SOCIALISM' AGAINST STATE BROKERAGE OF THE COMMONS UNDER MARKET SOCIALISM.
807	THE COLOMBIAN POLITICAL REGIME MOVES BETWEEN ONE INSTITUTIONAL FORM THAT PROCLAIMS THE RULE OF LAW AND PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY, AND AN ARMED CONFLICT THAT LEADS IT TO BEHAVIOR TYPICAL OF AN AUTHORITARIAN STATE, DUE TO THE WAR STRATEGIES OF THE GOVERNMENT AND GUERRILLA GROUPS. HOWEVER, THE INSTITUTIONALITY ESTABLISHED BY THE 1991 CONSTITUTION AND TENDENCIES TOWARD AN AUTHORITARIAN STATE EXHIBIT NOT ONLY TENSIONS AND CONFLICTS, BUT ALSO COMPLEMENTARITIES THAT ARE MUTUALLY REINFORCING AND HAVE THEIR ROOTS IN THE WEAKNESSES OF A MINIMAL NATIONAL CONSENSUS TO BUILD A SUSTAINABLE PEACE AND A DEMOCRACY THAT RESPOND TO THE COUNTRY'S DIVERSE WAYS OF LIVE.
808	THE CONTRIBUTION PRESENTS SOME CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS IN ORDER TO THE CLAIM TO RECOGNIZE THE "RULE" OF THE AUTONOMY AND, CONSEQUENTLY, OF THE LAW IN ORDER A SUSTAIN AN ANALYSIS ABOUT L. 40/2004. HIGHLIGHTING THE VAGUENESS OF THE NOTION OF "SOVEREIGNTY" AND ITS CRISIS, THE AUTHOR RECOVERS SOME PARADIGMS OF JURIDICAL AND POLITICAL THEORY TO RECOGNIZE A RENEWED IMPORTANCE OF THE CLASSICAL THOUGHT. THE CONTRIBUTION MAKES AN ATTEMPT TO ANALYZE THE STATE CRISIS WITH THE AIM OF RECOGNIZING THE ROOTS OF THIS CRISIS, ESPECIALLY IN VERIFYING THE FAILURE TO RESPECT THE "AUTONOMY" AS THE ORIGIN OF THE RULE OF LAW.
809	THIS RESEARCH EXAMINES THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS' QUALITY IN THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THE BANKING SECTOR IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. HENCE, SEMI-PARAMETRIC REGRESSION MODELS ARE USED WITH BANK LEVEL DETAILED PANEL DATA FROM 2000 TO 2014 DRAWN FROM THE WEST AFRICAN ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION (WAEMU) COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT, DEPENDING ON THE TYPES OF INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES USED TO CONDITION THE PROPOSED DYNAMIC PANZAR-ROSSE H-STATISTICS, SOME INSTITUTIONS' QUALITY VARIABLES SUCH AS CORRUPTION CONTROL, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND THE RULE OF LAW DISPLAY U-SHAPED RELATIONSHIPS. EFFORTS IN INSTITUTIONS' QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ABOVE CERTAIN ESTIMATED THRESHOLDS ARE REQUIRED TO ENHANCE BANKING MARKET COMPETITIVENESS
810	WESTERN COUNTRIES HAVE ADOPTED SECURITY MEASURES TO FIGHT AGAINST THE TERRORIST THREAT. THESE MEASURES AFFECT INDIVIDUAL AS WELL AS COLLECTIVE RIGHTS. DUE TO THE WORST TERRORIST THREAT, THE JIHADIST ONE, FREEDOM OF RELIGION IS ALSO AFFECTED. THE PAPER ANALYZES DIRECT REPERCUSSION OF ANTITERRORIST PREVENTIVE OR REPRESSIVE MEASURES IN THE RIGHT OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. IT ALSO STUDIES OTHER ONES ONLY REMOTELY RELATED TO SECURITY: THESE "DIFFUSE" OR "UNSPECIFIC" MEASURES CONSIDER ISLAM, AS A WHOLE, A THREAT TO WESTERN VALUES. FINALLY WE DISCUSS ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SECURITY AND FREEDOM -UNDER THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY RULE OF LAW- AND THE STATU QUO OF ISLAM IN EUROPE.
811	THIS ESSAY SEEKS TO EXPOSE DOCTRINAL CONTRIBUTIONS APPLICABLE TO CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW. AFTER AN BRIEF INTRODUCTION, THEORISTS ASPECTS WILL BE ANALYZED WITH THE PURPOSE TO ENHANCE THE IMPORTANCE OF INDIVIDUAL FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS PROTECTION. MOREOVER, THE OBJECTIVE IS TO EMPHASYZE THE STATE'S LEGITIMACY OF INTERVENTION (WHICH IS EVEN DONE THROUGH THE CRIMINAL PROCESS WITHIN THE ASPECTS OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS AND RIGHTS), TAKING THE PROPORTIONALITY PRINCIPLE AS A STARTING POINT. FINNALY, ASPECTS OF DIFFERENTIATION BETWEN THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY FROM THE GERMAN DOCTRINE AND PRINCIPLE OF RAZOABILITY FROM THE UNITED STATES AND ENGLAND DOCTRINE.
812	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDICATORS OF GOVERNANCE AND PER CAPITA FOREIGN AID IN A CROSS-SECTION OF SEVEN PICS. CONTROLLING FOR POOR ECONOMIC GROWTH, FOREIGN EXCHANGE SHORTAGE AND SMALL SIZE, A FIXED-EFFECTS MODEL CORRECTING FOR AR (1) ERRORS IS TESTED FOR THE PERIOD 1996-2004 THAT INCORPORATES FIVE MEASURES OF GOVERNANCE. THE FINDINGS HERE CONFIRM THAT VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION ARE NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH PER CAPITA FOREIGN AID. HOWEVER, REGULATORY QUALITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS ARE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH PER CAPITA FOREIGN AID. SOME POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DRAWN. COPYRIGHT (C) 2008 JOHN WILEY & SONS, LTD.
813	THE PAPER INVESTIGATES EMPIRICALLY HOW GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS MEDIATE THE LINK BETWEEN FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND INEQUALITY. TO THIS AIM, WE ASSEMBLE A DATASET OF 48 MIDDLE-AND HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 1996-2014. RESULTS, OBTAINED BY MEANS OF INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES DYNAMIC PANEL DATA MODELS, REVEAL THAT FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT IS PRO-INEQUALITY; HOWEVER, THE STRENGTH OF THE RELATIONSHIP IS ATTENUATED IN CONTEXTS WITH STRICTER CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, BETTER REGULATORY QUALITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND RULE OF LAW. INSTITUTIONAL DOMAINS LESS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE MARKET ECONOMY - POLITICAL VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS - DO NOT PLAY ANY MEDIATING ROLE.
814	THIS PAPER EVALUATES THE EXPORT VALUES OF MANUFACTURED GOODS FOR THE CENTRAL ASIAN COUNTRIES USING A GRAVITY TRADE MODEL AND INVESTIGATES THE ROLES OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITIES IN MANUFACTURING EXPORTS BASED ON THE WORLD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS. WITH KAZAKHSTAN BEING A BENCHMARK COUNTRY, THE REMAINING FOUR CENTRAL ASIAN COUNTRIES HAVE DOWNWARD DEVIATIONS IN MANUFACTURING EXPORTS AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITIES. THEN, THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITIES SUCH AS CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND RULE OF LAW ARE IDENTIFIED TO BE THE MAJOR FACTORS TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES IN THE MANUFACTURING EXPORTS' PERFORMANCES.
815	FROM THE POPULAR ACTION BROUGHT BY EVENTS GENERATED BY THE WATERSHED LA PICACHA IN MEDELLIN, THE PUBLIC INTEREST LAW CLINIC OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITY (UNAULA) DISCUSSES THE CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WITH GENDER PERSPECTIVE PRESENTED IN THE JUDICIAL PROCESS. INITIALLY, THE ARTICLE REFERS TO CLINICAL LEGAL EDUCATION AS A PEDAGOGICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK HOSTING EXPERIENCE; MAKES A CONTEXTUALIZATION OF THE PHENOMENON JUDICIALIZED ADDRESSES GENDER AS A CATEGORY OF ANALYSIS TO REALIZE THE RULE OF LAW, PREVENTION AND DISASTER GENDERED, RISKS AND DAMAGES THAT WOMEN FACE IN A NATURAL DISASTER, CULMINATING IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GENDER MAINSTREAMING IN THE INTERVENTION OF LA PICACHA CASE, AND SOME CONCLUSIONS.
816	WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES TO FUTURE DEMOCRATIZATION IN STATES REGARDED AS DEMOCRATIC? THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT SOME STATES THAT ARE TRADITIONALLY REGARDED AS DEMOCRATIC CONSIST OF POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS IN NEED OF FURTHER DEMOCRATIZATION. ON AVERAGE, STATES THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS DEMOCRATIC HAVE ONE OR TWO INSTITUTIONAL DIMENSIONS IN NEED OF FURTHER DEMOCRATIZATION. THE MAIN INSTITUTIONAL DIMENSIONS IN NEED OF DEMOCRATIZATION ARE FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT, RULE OF LAW, PERSONAL AUTONOMY AND INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE CHALLENGES TO FUTURE DEMOCRATIZATION, THE STUDY PRESENTS A METHODOLOGY THAT USES FREEDOM HOUSE INDEX AND POLITY INDEX IN A NEW INNOVATIVE WAY.
817	ORGANIZED CRIME IN THE BALKANS HAS BECOME INGRAINED, AND THIS IS NOW SERIOUSLY UNDERMINING TO VARYING DEGREES THE NORMAL FUNCTIONING OF THE STATES IN THE REGION. GEOPOLITICAL AND DOMESTIC CONDITIONS PROVIDED CRIMINAL GROUPS AN INCREASING RANGE OF FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES. IN A REGION WHERE THE RULE OF LAW AND GOOD GOVERNANCE ARE SCARCE, THE COMBINATION OF STATE WEAKNESS AND CRIMINALITY POSES A THREAT WITH GRAVE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS. THE FURTHER PROGRESS OF DEMOCRACY THEREFORE GOES HAND-IN-HAND WITH THE FIGHT AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIME, FOR NO REGIONAL COUNTRY CAN AFFORD THE SOCIAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC COSTS THAT IT ENTAILS.
818	EARLY NEOCLASSICAL ANALYSES PREDICTED THAT POOR COUNTRIES WOULD GROW FASTER THAN WEALTHY COUNTRIES, BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND DIMINISHING RETURNS TO CAPITAL IN THE LATTER. THE REVERSE HAS OCCURRED: POOR COUNTRIES ARE FALLING BACK RATHER THAN CATCHING UP. WE SUGGEST HERE THAT DEFICIENT INSTITUTIONS UNDERLIE THIS DIVERGENCE. EMPLOYING VARIOUS INDICATORS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, INCLUDING THE RULE OF LAW, THE PERVASIVENESS OF CORRUPTION, AND THE RISK OF EXPROPRIATION AND CONTRACT REPUDIATION, WE SHOW THAT THE ABILITY OF POOR COUNTRIES TO CATCH UP IS DETERMINED IN LARGE PART BY THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THESE COUNTRIES RAKES PLACE.
819	THIS STUDY ANALYZES PERCEIVED CORRUPTION FOLLOWING PRIVATIZATION REFORMS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE QUALITY IN 22 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES FROM 2002 TO 2013. INITIAL ANALYSIS DID NOT REVEAL SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PERCEIVED CORRUPTION AFTER PRIVATIZATION REFORMS, BUT THE RESULTS ARE MODERATED BY GOVERNANCE QUALITY. IN GENERAL, THE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT CORRUPTION IS LOWER WHEN THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE INCREASES, AND IT ADDITIONALLY AFFECTS PERCEIVED CORRUPTION AFTER PRIVATIZATION REFORMS. CONCRETELY, ACCOUNTABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION MECHANISMS ARE ESSENTIAL TO PREVENT CORRUPTION AFTER PRIVATIZATION.

820	IN HISTORICAL AND STRATEGIC CONTEXT, THE ARGUMENT OF THE LAWS IN PLATO'S CRITO SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD NOT AS AN ARGUMENT FOR LEGAL OBEDIENCE IN GENERAL, BUT AS AN ARGUMENT AGAINST THE PUBLIC DISPLAY OF LEGAL IMPUNITY (I.E., PROCURED BY BRIBERY). STABLE DEMOCRATIC AUTHORITY REQUIRES THE THREAT OF MASS COLLECTIVE ACTION IN SUPPORT OF THE RULE OF LAW. BUT THAT THREAT IS NOT CREDIBLE WITHOUT WIDESPREAD TRUST BY CITIZENS IN THEIR FELLOWS' COMMITMENT TO THE LAW. SOCRATES'S IMPUNITY WOULD HAVE UNDERMINED THAT TRUST. AS A CITIZEN WITH A STAKE IN THE DEMOCRACY, HE HAD COMPELLING REASON NOT TO DO SO.
821	THIS PAPER CONSTRUCTS THE FLOAT ADJUSTED MEASURE OF HOME BIAS AND EXPLORES THE DETERMINANTS OF BOND HOME BIAS BY EMPLOYING THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND'S HIGH QUALITY DATASET (2001 TO 2009) ON CROSS-BORDER BOND INVESTMENT. THE PAPER FINDS THAT AUSTRALIAN INVESTORS' PREFER INVESTING IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND MORE DEVELOPED BOND MARKETS. EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY APPEARS TO BE AN IMPEDIMENT FOR CROSS-BORDER BOND INVESTMENT. INVESTORS PREFER INVESTING IN COUNTRIES WITH STRONGER QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING BUREAUCRATIC QUALITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, EFFICIENCY OF JUDICIAL SYSTEM, RISK OF CONTRACT REPUDIATION, AND RATING OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.
822	THE IDEA OF THE VIRAL-METAMORPHIC THEORY WAS 'INSPIRED' BY HANNA ARENDT'S ASSERTION THAT TOTALITARIANISM IS THE PATHOLOGY OF MODERNITY. THEREFORE, TOTALITARIANISM IS NOT THE OPPOSITE OF DEMOCRACY, BUT A MUTANT ENTITY DERIVED FROM IT. THE TOTALITARIAN PHENOMENON EMERGES WHEN CHANGE OCCURS AND MODIFIES CERTAIN ESSENTIAL ASPECTS OF DEMOCRATIC THOUGHT AND ACTION, SUCH AS FREEDOM, EQUALITY, INDIVIDUALISM, SOCIAL CONTRACTUALISM, RATIONALISM, SOCIAL JUSTICE, THE RULE OF LAW, ETC. RIGHT-WING TOTALITARIANISM HAS SYNCRETICALLY COMBINED SEVERAL TRANS-IDEOLOGIES BECOMING AN IDEOLOGY IN ITSELF WITH A UNIQUE AND UTOPIAN VIEW OF THE WORLD, BUILT OF MYTHS, ARCHETYPES, SYMBOLS, MAGICAL THOUGHT, AND TABOOS.
823	THIS PAPER ATTEMPTS TO SCRUTINIZE THE IMPACT OF NATURAL RESOURCES, CULTURAL, GEOGRAPHICAL, AND INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS ON CHINESE OFDI TOWARD OBOR SIGNATORIES BY USING THE GRAVITY MODEL. THE EMPIRICAL ESTIMATES VALIDATED A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHINA'S AND OBOR PARTNERS' GDP, AND THE NEGATIVE INFLUENCE OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTANCE ON CHINESE OFDI. INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS (GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, CORRUPTION CONTROL, RULE OF LAW, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, REGULARITY QUALITY) HAVE SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE, WHILE CULTURAL FACTORS (SHARED BORDER, COMMON LANGUAGE) HAVE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT ON CHINESE OFDI. ALSO, CURRENT FINDINGS DISCLOSE THAT THE HOST ECONOMY'S NATURAL RESOURCES ACT AS KEY DRIVER FOR CHINESE OFDI IN OBOR.
824	NEW LEGAL REALISM (NLR) FURTHERS THE LEGAL REALIST LEGACY BY FOCUSING ATTENTION ON BOTH THE PERTINENT SOCIAL SCIENCE AND THE CRAFT THAT TYPIFIES LEGAL DISCOURSE AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS. NLR'S GLOBALIZED AMBITIONS ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE POTENTIAL OF A NONSTATIST VIEW OF LAW. THE REALIST VIEW OF LAW RAISES THREE CHALLENGES FACING NLR: IDENTIFYING THE LINGUA FRANCA OF LAW AS AN ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE WITHIN WHICH NLR INSIGHTS ON TRANSLATION AND SYNTHESIS SHOULD BE SITUATED; CONCEPTUALIZING NLR'S FOCUS ON BOTTOM-UP INVESTIGATION, SO THAT IT DOES NOT DEFY THE RULE OF LAW; AND RECOGNIZING THE NORMATIVE UNDERPINNING FOR NLR'S REFORMIST IMPULSE.
825	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES ECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS TO FISCAL POLICY IMPLEMENTATION IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. WE FIND THAT PLANNED FISCAL ADJUSTMENTS OR EXPANSIONS ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE IMPLEMENTED THE LARGER THEY ARE, THE MORE FRAGILE THE RULE OF LAW IN THE COUNTRY, AND THE WEAKER THE INSTITUTIONS FRAMING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ANNUAL FISCAL BUDGET. THE FINDINGS SUPPORT ONGOING EFFORTS IN THE REGION TO ENHANCE FORECASTING CAPACITY; ADOPT REALISTIC FISCAL PLANS; AND STRENGTHEN GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES, WITH A FOCUS ON ACCOUNTING, REPORTING, AND EXTERNAL CONTROLS OF GOVERNMENT'S FISCAL ACCOUNTS.

826	THE PURPOSE OF OUR ARTICLE IS TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF DIVERSE INDICATORS PERTAINING TO GOVERNMENT QUALITY AND RISK ON FISCAL PRESSURE. THE ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON 14 EMERGING COUNTRIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION FROM 2002 TO 2020. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT PUBLIC GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ACCOUNT FOR 51 PERCENT OF THE VARIANCE IN FISCAL PRESSURE, WITH THE QUALITY OF REGULATIONS, CORRUPTION, AND RULE OF LAW INDICATORS HAVING THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. THIS EMPIRICAL STUDY ADDRESSES AN ESSENTIAL CONCERN FOR POLICYMAKERS, SPECIFICALLY THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND ITS SUBSEQUENT INFLUENCE ON FISCAL PRESSURE, WITH DIRECT REPERCUSSIONS ON THE LIVES OF CITIZENS.
827	BASED ON A SAMPLE OF 76 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES OVER 1990-2019, WE ASSESS THE EFFECT OF ADOPTING MOBILE MONEY ON CONSUMPTION VOLATILITY USING ENTROPY BALANCING. WE REVEAL THAT COUNTRIES WITH MOBILE MONEY EXHIBIT LOWER CONSUMPTION VOLATILITY. AFTER CHECKING THE ROBUSTNESS OF THIS RESULT, WE SHOW THAT THE KEY DRIVERS OF MOBILE MONEY'S STABILIZING EFFECT ARE FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND MIGRANT REMITTANCES. HETEROGENEITY TESTS CONDUCTED INDICATE THE SENSITIVITY OF THE RESULT TO TIME AND TYPE OF MOBILE MONEY AND TO SOME STRUCTURAL FACTORS, INCLUDING TRADE OPENNESS, INFLATION, RURAL POPULATION, THE RULE OF LAW, AND LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT.

828	STUDYING THE INTER-PLAY BETWEEN SOCIAL CAPITAL AND CORRUPTION AVERSION IN A CONTEXT SUBJECT TO INSTITUTIONAL DYSFUNCTIONS LIKE THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES MAY HELP UNDERSTAND MECHANISMS OF GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY. BY USING A UNIQUE SURVEY CONDUCTED IN 2007 IN THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES, WE FIND THAT CORRUPTION AVERSION INCREASES WITH CIVIC SPIRITS AND IS LOWER AMONG INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN VOLUNTARY ACTIVITIES. FURTHERMORE, CORRUPTION AVERSION AND SOCIAL CAPITAL INCREASE WITH INSTITUTIONAL TRUST AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW. THESE RESULTS ARE INTEGRATED WITHIN THE CURRENT DEBATE ON THE ROLE THAT IDENTITY-BASED MOTIVATIONS OF MORAL SOLIDARITY PLAY IN SUPPORTING INSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY.
829	THIS PAPER AIMS TO ANALYZE THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS INTO FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) EFFECT ON GROWTH OF GDP PER CAPITA FOR 41 SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES (SSA). FOR THAT END, WE USE PTR MODEL ACROSS THREE YEARS AVERAGE DATA OVER THE PERIOD 1996-2016. ECONOMETRIC ESTIMATIONS SHOW VOICE AND ACCOUNTANCY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATION QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW HAVE A CATALYST ROLE, WITH SOME PARTICULAR THRESHOLD, INTO THE EFFECT OF FDI ON GROWTH ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY SHOW AN AMBIGUOUS EFFECT OF FIGHTING AGAINST CORRUPTION AND POLITICAL STABILITY. ANALYSIS ALSO SHOWS DIFFERENTIATED EFFECTS AMONG SOME REGIONAL ECONOMIC COMMUNITIES OF SSA.
830	WE ARE LIVING IN AN AGE OF POLITICAL TURBULENCE, SOCIAL DIVISION, AND RESISTANCE. THE RESISTANCE THAT FORMED IN REACTION TO THE ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP STYLES ITSELF A FORCE TO DEFEND CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, DEMOCRATIC NORMS, AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE UNITED STATES. PERHAPS THE NEW REPUBLIC BEST EXPLAINED ITS ADVENT: THE RESISTANCE HAD BEEN BORN OF PARTISANTHAT IS, DEMOCRATICFURY AFTER LIBERALISM HAD BEEN DEALT ITS MOST STUNNING AND CONSEQUENTIAL DEFEAT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES, LIBERALISM HAS BEEN INFUSED WITH A SENSE OF ENERGY AND PURPOSE, WITH MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DEVOTED TO A SINGULAR CAUSE: RESISTING TRUMP.
831	FOLLOWING WENDY BROWN'S THEORETICAL REFLECTIONS ON NEOLIBERAL POLITICAL RATIONALITY, THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES SOME OF THE IMPACTS THIS HAS FOR LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES. THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON A THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF NEOLIBERAL POLITICAL RATIONALITY AND WHAT EFFECTS THIS HAS HAD ON DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS FREE ELECTIONS AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE. THE CHANGE FROM LEGISLATIVE POLITICS TO THE RULE OF LAW IS ALSO PUT INTO QUESTION TO UNDERSTAND HOW CHANGES IN INSTITUTIONAL POWER ARE TAKING PLACE WITHIN THE POLITICAL RATIONALITY OF NEOLIBERALISM. ALONGSIDE WITH THIS CHANGE OF POWER, THE DISCURSIVE REARTICULATION OF DEMOCRATIC TERMS INTO NEOLIBERAL MARKET RATIONALITY IS PUT INTO QUESTION.
832	THE PROBLEM OF ANARCHIST VIOLENCE ATTRACTED MUCH PUBLIC ATTENTION IN THE KAISERREICH. COMMENTATORS ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM SAW IT AS A SYMPTOM OF MODERN SOCIETY'S ILLS. LEFT LIBERALS BLAMED THE (ANTI-)SOCIALIST LAWS AND THE SUBSEQUENT WAVE OF POLICE REPRESSION FOR CREATING A GERMAN ANARCHIST MOVEMENT. THEY ARGUED THAT A RETURN TO THE RULE OF LAW AND RESPECT FOR THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH WOULD ELIMINATE ANARCHIST TERRORISM. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY CONTENDED THAT ANARCHIST IDEAS PROVIDED A VALUABLE ANTIDOTE TO THE NEAR-UNIVERSAL ENTHUSIASM FOR THE EXPANSION OF STATE POWER, WHICH WAS THREATENING INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY.
833	USING DATA FOR A SET OF 823 R&D-INTENSE MANUFACTURING FIRMS WITHIN THE TRIAD AND THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT (QOG) DATASET OVER THE 2002-2010 PERIOD, THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY UPON FIRMS' INEFFICIENCY, THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF A STOCHASTIC FRONTIER APPROACH (SFA). EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE, WHICH IS ROBUST TO ALTERNATIVE SPECIFICATIONS OF THE TECHNOLOGY EMPLOYED AND DIFFERENT LAG STRUCTURES IN R&D ACTIVITIES, REVEALS THAT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE FIRMS' INEFFICIENCY AND SUGGESTS THAT, AMONG THE SET OF RELEVANT INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS CONSIDERED, A PRE-EMINENT ROLE IS FOUND FOR THE RULE OF LAW.
834	UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONSTITUTIONALISM AND DEMOCRACY AMONG LEGAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHERS REFLECTS AN IDEALISED ACCOUNT OF THE US CONSTITUTION AND THE NATURE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW. THIS VIEW IS NORMATIVELY AND EMPIRICALLY FLAWED. THE US CONSTITUTION IS BUILT ON PREDEMOCRATIC ASSUMPTIONS AND ITS COUNTER-MAJORITARIAN CHECKS AND BALANCES ARE LARGELY REGRESSIVE, BENEFITTING PRIVILEGED MINORITIES OVER THE UNDERPRIVILEGED. BY CONTRAST, 'ACTUALLY EXISTING DEMOCRACY, INVOLVING COMPETING PARTIES AND MAJORITY RULE, IS CONSTITUTIONAL IN ITS PROCESS AND EFFECTS, TREATING ALL WITH EQUAL CONCERN AND RESPECT, UPHOLDING RIGHTS AND MAINTAINING THE RULE OF LAW. JUDICIAL REVIEW UNDERMINES THESE BENEFICIAL QUALITIES.
835	'GULF WAR SYNDROME', WHICH PUT JAPAN'S `COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY' IN A DILEMMA, TRIGGERED A RECONSIDERATION OF JAPAN'S OVERALL SECURITY POLICY. THE HEATED ARGUMENTS CENTRING ON JAPAN'S 'INTERNATIONAL CONTRIBUTION' DURING THE FIRST GULF WAR (1990-91) EVENTUALLY LED TO THE CONCEPTION OF 'HUMAN SECURITY'. IT IS AGAINST THIS NEW SECURITY POLICY THAT JAPAN ADDRESSED THE EAST TIMOR ISSUE (1999). NOTABLY UNLIKE MAINSTREAM LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION BUILDING, WHICH EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE GROWTH OF DEMOCRATIC TRADITIONS AND THE RULE OF LAW, JAPAN'S POLICY OF HUMAN SECURITY IS CENTRED ON CAPACITY-BUILDING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.
836	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE DRIVERS OF THE SHADOW ECONOMY WITHIN THE BALTIC REGION, EMPHASIZING THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, A MISSING FEATURE FROM THE EXTANT LITERATURE. TO THIS END, WE ANALYZED AN ANNUAL DATASET COVERING THE 2009-2019 PERIOD FOR ESTONIA, LATVIA, AND LITHUANIA USING PANEL ARDL AND OBTAINED POOLED MEAN GROUP (PMG) ESTIMATES. EMPIRICAL FINDINGS INDICATE THAT A RISE IN THE TAX BURDEN, FURTHER FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, AND INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT RESULTS IN THE EXPANSION OF THE SHADOW ECONOMY. HOWEVER, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL STABILITY CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONTRACTION OF THE SHADOW ECONOMY.
837	THE PAPER PRESENTS AN EXPLORATORY CASE STUDY ON THE OPERATION OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS (IGR) IN MEXICO DURING THE MANAGEMENT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC TO IDENTIFY AND EXPLAIN THE MAIN CONFLICTS FACED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE EMERGENCY. THE MAIN FINDINGS ARE: MEXICO IS UNDERGOING AN AGGRESSIVE RE-CENTRALIZATION PROCESS ENCOURAGED BY INEQUALITIES AMONG STATES AND THEIR LACK OF PROFESSIONAL PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEMS; 2) FORMAL RULES FOR BALANCING IGR LOSE VALUE VERSUS INFORMAL RULES BASED ON TRANSITORY POLITICAL-PARTISAN AGREEMENTS; 3) THE WEAKNESS OF THE RULE OF LAW, POWER IMBALANCES, LACK OF CLEAR RULES, AND COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS DIFFICULT INTERGOVERNMENTAL COLLABORATION IN EMERGENCIES MANAGEMENT.
838	THE DETERIORATING SITUATION OF MIGRANT WORKERS' HEALTH RIGHTS PROTECTION WAS ONCE AGAIN HIGHLIGHTED IN THE CASE OF TSENG HEI-TAO. THIS CASE EXPLICITLY AND IMPLICITLY SHOWED THAT FOUR CONUNDRUMS-THE EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTION CONUNDRUM, THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH (OSH) LEGAL CONUNDRUM, THE MORALITY CONUNDRUM AND THE IDENTITY CONUNDRUM-ARE BARRIERS TO MIGRANT WORKERS' RIGHT PROTECTION. THE HEALTH RIGHTS OF MIGRANT WORKERS COULD BE SAFEGUARDED BY ABOLISHING THE OUTDATED HOUSEHOLD REGISTRATION SYSTEM DESIGNED IN THE PLANNED ECONOMY ERA, IMPROVING THE RULE OF LAW, AND STRENGTHENING ADMINISTRATIVE SUPERVISIONS. THIS WOULD FUNDAMENTALLY REMOVE THESE BARRIERS AND THUS CONTRIBUTE TO MIGRANT WORKERS' HEALTH RIGHTS PROTECTION.
839	THIS ARTICLE SUMMARIZES THE FEATURES OF MODERN NON-DEMOCRATIC LEGAL SYSTEMS AND DRAWS THE RELEVANT CONCLUSIONS. SOME OF THESE SYSTEMIC ISSUES HAVE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES. THE ARTICLE ILLUSTRATES THE DEFINING EFFECTS OF THE HISTORICAL TRADITIONS WITH CONCRETE EXAMPLES BASED ON EMPIRICAL RESEARCHES. JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AS PART OF THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT ONLY INSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES BUT CULTURAL, MENTAL DISPOSITIONS TOO. THIS ARTICLE SHOWS HOW NON-DEMOCRATIC LEGAL HERITAGE LED TO BACKSLIDING DEMOCRACY IN POST-COMMUNIST HUNGARY. HOWEVER RELATIVE AUTONOMY OF JUDGES COULD EMERGE DURING THE LAST THREE DECADES OF THE COMMUNIST RULE, SKILLS AND HABITS OF PROFESSIONAL SELF-DEFENSE COULD NOT STABILIZE.
840	THIS INTERVENTION IS BASED ON RESEARCH IN CAMBODIA ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND FORCED EVICTION. IT DRAWS ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN RULE OF/BY LAW TO EXAMINE WOMEN'S EXPERIENCES OF RIGHTS CLAIMING. WHILE RULE OF LAW' IS A VALUE TO BE RESPECTED AND A MECHANISM VIA WHICH TO GUARANTEE JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS TO ALL CITIZENS, RULE BY LAW' IS A DISTORTION THAT IS MORE EASILY CONCEIVED OF AS AN INSTRUMENT OF POWER AND OPPRESSION. THE INTERVENTION'S EMPHASIS ON THE BLURRING BETWEEN THESE DISTINCTIONS HIGHLIGHTS THE STARK ABSENCE OF FEMINIST GEOGRAPHY WORK IN THE GROWING FIELD OF LEGAL GEOGRAPHIES.
841	CIVIL JUSTICE, TRADITIONALLY CONSIDERED A FUNCTION OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, HAS HAD, IT IS ARGUED IN THIS ARTICLE, ITS DECISION-MAKING FUNCTION LARGELY SUPPLANTED BY A SYSTEM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY PRIVATE, PROFIT-MAKING ACTORS AND AGENCIES, RELATING TO BOTH ARBITRATORS AND MEDIATORS. THIS DEVELOPMENT, ALLOWED TO THRIVE IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF DEREGULATION, IS EXPLORED IN THIS ARTICLE. THE AUTHOR HIGHLIGHTS ISSUES SUCH AS THE DELEGATION OF PUBLIC POWER, LACK OF TRANSPARENCY, THE DANGER OF IMPARTIALITY, THE SUBTLE INFLUENCE OF REPEAT PLAYERS AND INEQUALITY IN BARGAINING POWER, RAISING SERIOUS ISSUES ABOUT CIVIL JUSTICE AND EVEN THE RULE OF LAW, BEFORE BRIEFLY OFFERING POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS.
842	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE PROCESS BY WHICH TEMPORARY GUEST WORKERS RECRUITED TO WORK IN WEST GERMANY BETWEEN 1955 AND 1973 BECAME DE FACTO IMMIGRANTS, THUS TRANSFORMING THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY INTO AN IMMIGRATION COUNTRY. WE ARGUE THAT WEST GERMANY DID NOT PRACTICE A TRUE GUEST WORKER POLICY DURING THIS PERIOD BECAUSE POLICYMAKERS NEVER IMPLEMENTED A MECHANISM FOR ENSURING THE CONSISTENT ROTATION OF FOREIGN WORKERS. DRAWING ON A RANGE OF PRIMARY SOURCES, THE PAPER DEMONSTRATES THAT COMPULSORY ROTATION COULD NOT BE RECONCILED WITH WEST GERMANY'S POSTWAR IDENTITY AS A LIBERAL DEMOCRACY, SUPPORTIVE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW.
843	THERE IS A PERCEPTION OF A CRISIS OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE IN THE COMPARATIVE LAW ARENA. THIS CRISIS WOULD BE ONE OF ACCESS AS ONE OF RELEVANCE. FROM THIS CRITICS, WHICH PROVIDES A NEW INSIGHT TO THE EXISTING STUDIES IN CHILE, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES THE FINDINGS OF AN EMPIRICAL RESEARCH OVER CIVIL COURTS OF SANTIAGO, WHICH SHOWS, FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW, A STATE OF AFFAIRS EVEN WORST FROM WHAT IS DESCRIBED IN OUR LEGAL COMMUNITY. FROM ITS FINDINGS, I PROPOSE A REORIENTATION OF THE REFORM PROCESS FOCUSING ON ACCESS TO FORMAL JUSTICE AND REASSESSING ITS VALUE FOR THE RULE OF LAW.
844	IN THE YEARS BETWEEN 2014 AND 2018, IN JUDGEMENTS ALTMANN, BAUMEISTER, UBS AND BUCCIONI, THE COURT EXAMINED THE SCOPE OF THE OBLIGATION OF PROFESSIONAL SECRECY INCUMBENT ON FINANCIAL AND BANKING SUPERVISORY AUTHORITIES OF MEMBER STATES PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 54 MIFID AND ARTICLE 53 CRD. THE COURT HAS NOT ONLY CLARIFIED THE NOTION OF "CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION" BUT HAS ALSO PROVIDED GUIDANCE TO NATIONAL COURTS ON HOW TO RECONCILE THE CONCERNS WHICH UNDERPIN THE OBLIGATION OF PROFESSIONAL SECRECY LAID DOWN BY THE EU LEGISLATOR IN THIS FIELD AND CERTAIN CORE VALUES TO DEMOCRACY AND TO THE RULE OF LAW IN THE EU.
845	ACCOUNTABILITY IS A CORE PUBLIC LAW, IF NOT CONSTITUTIONAL, VALUE, WITH CLOSE TIES TO THE RULE OF LAW AND SEPARATION OF POWERS. DESPITE THIS STATUS, THE AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC LAW SYSTEM PRESENTS ONLY A THIN REFLECTION OF ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS IS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES CONTROL OF PUBLIC POWER BUT NOT RESTORATION OR PUNISHMENT IN CASES OF ABUSE OF POWER. THIS ARTICLE USES THE CONCEPT OF ACCOUNTABILITY AS A LENS THROUGH WHICH TO VIEW THE LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING PUBLIC LAW REMEDIES AND BRIEFLY OUTLINES TWO OF THE POTENTIAL EXPLANATIONS FOR THESE LIMITATIONS: CONSTITUTIONAL BARRIERS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES.
846	THE PURPOSE OF THIS WORK IS TO DISCOURSE ABOUT THE INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND CRIMINAL POLITICS IN THE STATE OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW. FIRSTLY, IT WILL BE EXPLAINED THE EVOLUTION THE BRAZILIAN ENVIRONMENTAL LAW SINCE THE ORDINANCES OF THE KINGDOM.SECONDLY IT WILL APPROACH THE ISSUE IN REGARD TO THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS STEPS UNTIL BECOMING STATE OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, SHOWING, INCLUSIVE, ITS RELATION WITH THE CRIMINAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS. AT LAST, IT IS GOING TO ANALYZE, ACCORDING TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL STATE, THE ENVIRONMENTAL PENAL TUTELAGE, EVALUATING THE DOCTRINE OPINIONS ON THE SUBJECT AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS PROTECTION.
847	THE FOLLOWING STUDY, INTEGRATING PUBLIC CHOICE THEORY AND EVOLUTIONARY GAME THEORY, DEVELOPS A PREDATOR-PREY MODEL WITH INTELLIGENT DESIGN TO EXPLAIN THE "EVOLUTIONARY-INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE" THAT IS A WELL-ACCEPTED PREMISE IN TRANSITIONAL ECONOMICS. IN THE MODEL, GROWTH-ORIENTED CENTRAL GOVERNMENT LEADERS ARE INTELLIGENT DESIGNERS OF INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE, PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE POTENTIAL PREDATORS, AND PRIVATE FIRMS ARE POTENTIAL PREY. THE MODEL FINDS THAT REDUCTIONS IN DISCRIMINATORY POLICIES ARE THE MAJOR INSTITUTIONAL CONTRIBUTORS TO CHINA'S MARKET MIRACLE, WHEREAS IMPROVEMENTS IN THE RULE OF LAW AND IN THE PROTECTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE NOT NEEDED FOR SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC GROWTH.
848	A SPECIALIST ON RUSSIAN LAW AND POLITICS EXAMINES PUTIN'S USE OF LAW TO ADVANCE HIS POLITICAL AND POLICY AGENDAS. THE ARTICLE EXPLORES WHETHER THESE APPROACHES ARE STRENGTHENING OR WEAKENING DEVELOPMENT OF A "RULE OF LAW" WITHIN RUSSIA. ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON FEDERALISM REFORMS, ESPECIALLY THE LAWS AND PRACTICE OF THE "POWER VERTICAL," AS WELL AS HOW THE PRESIDENTIAL ENVOYS, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, AND THE PROCURACY ARE ENFORCING THE CONSTITUTION AMONG FEDERATION SUBJECTS. RESISTANCE TO CONSTITUTIONAL HARMONIZATION AND LEGAL STANDARDIZATION FROM ABOVE IS ALSO DISCUSSED. SOURCES INCLUDE LAWS, COURT DECISIONS, AND BOTH RUSSIAN LEGAL ANALYSIS AND POLITICAL COMMENTARY ON THE ISSUES.
849	INDONESIAN POLITICAL LEADERS IN THE MID-20TH CENTURY ATTEMPTED TO CREATE A NEW STATE FOUNDED BOTH ON THE RULE OF LAW AND ON THEIR UNDERSTANDINGS OF TRADITIONAL INDONESIAN COMMUNAL LIFE. THEY SOUGHT SIMULTANEOUSLY TO ''ADVANCE'' TOWARD MODERNIZATION AND INDUSTRIALIZATION AND TO PRESERVE OLDER, VILLAGE-LEVEL NORMS AND VALUES WHICH THEY PROJECTED ONTO THE NATIONAL LEGAL AND POLITICAL SCREEN. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE INCONSISTENCIES INHERENT IN THESE TWIN ASPIRATIONS AND THE CONTINUING TENSIONS, DURING A PERIOD OF RAPID GROWTH AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, BETWEEN RIGHTS-BASED CONCEPTIONS AND THOSE BASED ON AN IDEOLOGY OF HARMONY AND COMMUNAL VILLAGE LIFE.
850	THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE HISTORY OF RACE LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES AS DISTINCT FROM THE RULE OF LAW, AN IDEA FOUND IN THE WRITING AND SPEECHES OF SADIE TANNER MOSSELL ALEXANDER, THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN PHD IN ECONOMICS (1921). WE REVIEW THE RACE LAWS OF SLAVERY, LYNCHING, NEGRO JOBS, AND THE MAKING OF THE BLACK GHETTO. WE HIGHLIGHT THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF ALEXANDER AND OTHER EARLY AFRICAN AMERICAN ECONOMISTS AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE COST OF RACIAL EXCLUSION IN THE ECONOMICS PROFESSION AND HOW IT HAS IMPEDED THE PRODUCTION OF USEFUL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE WORKINGS OF THE US ECONOMY.
851	THIS CONTRIBUTION RESPONDS TO THE COMMENT ENTITLED 'INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY CONVERGENCE IN THE EURO AREA COUNTRIES: A NOTE AND FURTHER EVIDENCE' ON OUR EARLIER PUBLISHED ARTICLE IN THE JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES, VOLUME 28, ISSUE 3. BY USING THE SAME DATA ON GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION ANALYSED IN THE COMMENT, WE CONFIRM THE COEXISTENCE OF CERTAIN PROCESSES OF INSTITUTIONAL CONVERGENCE AND, AT THE SAME TIME, A TWO-SPEED EURO AREA IN INSTITUTIONAL TERMS, WITH AN INCREASING GAP BETWEEN CORE AND PERIPHERY COUNTRIES. THESE RESULTS HELP TO COMPLEMENT AND ENRICH THEIR CONCLUSIONS.
852	WHY IS ADMINISTRATIVE LAW SO NEGLECTED IN THE CURRICULA OF GRADUATE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN THE UNITED STATES? IN THE LIGHT OF PROFESSED ADHERENCE TO DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION AND RULE OF LAW, THIS GAP IN THE ACADEMIC EDUCATION OF PUBLIC SERVICE PROFESSIONALS SEEMS SURPRISING AND SOMEWHAT DISCONCERTING. PUBLIC SERVANTS ARE NOT ONLY EMPOWERED BUT OBLIGATED BY LAW TO USE THE POWER OF THE STATE TO MAKE DECISIONS AND TAKE ACTIONS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. YET, STUDY OF THE THEORY, PROCESSES, AND PRACTICES OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW SEEMS TO PLAY LITTLE OR NO PART IN THEIR PREPARATION FOR THESE TASKS.
853	THE STATE IS CONSIDERED A KEY POLITICAL RISK FOR FOREIGN INVESTORS IN RUSSIA. BUT COMPANIES CAN BE FORCED FROM THE MARKET BY COMPETITORS USING UNFAIR METHODS. THIS IS SEEN IN THE CASE OF SWEDISH MOBILE OPERATOR TELE2. THE REASON FOR THIS DOUBLE RISK IS A SOCIAL ORDER IN WHICH AN ELITE COALITION HAS SECURED ECONOMIC PRIVILEGES WHILE COMPETITORS ARE GRANTED ONLY LIMITED ACCESS. PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE NO MORE PROTECTED FROM POLITICAL INTERVENTION THAN THE POLITICAL WORLD IS FROM CORRUPTION BY POWERFUL ECONOMIC INTERESTS. RUSSIA DOES NOT NEED "MORE" STATE OR "LESS" STATE, BUT A STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW.
854	ANALYSING PANEL DATA FOR THE PERIOD 1975-2001 FROM A LARGE GROUP OF AFRICAN COUNTRIES, WE FIND THAT TRADE AND INSTITUTIONS (POLITICAL RIGHTS, CIVIL LIBERTIES AND THE RULE OF LAW) EXERT LITTLE INFLUENCE ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN THE FORM OF LITERACY. INTERESTINGLY, INCOME APPEARS TO BE, BY FAR, THE PRIMARY DETERMINANT OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, MEASURED BY LITERACY AND LIFE EXPECTANCY, BUT WITH STRONG DIMINISHING RETURNS. INCOME ALSO POSITIVELY AFFECTS INSTITUTIONS, ALTHOUGH THERE IS A THRESHOLD EFFECT, IN THE CASES OF POLITICAL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES. FINALLY, THE PAPER FINDS THAT TRADE AND LITERACY EXERCISE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS, RESPECTIVELY, ON POLITICAL RIGHTS.
855	THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO REFLECT ON THE PHENOMENON OF INTERPRETATION IN THE RULE OF LAW. FOR THIS REASON, TO CONSTRUCT A DIALOGUE WITH VARIOUS THEORETICAL HORIZONS ARE AMONG THE LEGAL THEORISTS OF NATURAL LAW AND LEGAL POSITIVIST THINKING WITHIN CONSTRUCTIVIST THEORIES SUCH AS DWORKIN AND HART, ARGUMENTATIVE THEORY AS ALEXY AND HABERMAS, PURE POSITIVISTS AS KELSEN, BETWEEN OTHER. ALL FEED HERMENEUTIC DISCOURSE WITH NEW CONCEPTS OF INTERPRETATION, AS NEW TRENDS IN LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS. THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THEORISTS IS ROUTED THROUGH QUESTIONS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF INTERPRETATION ON THE ISSUE OF INTEGRATING THE PRINCIPLES AND RULES.
856	THE PAPER AIMS TO RECONSTRUCT THE DOCTRINAL EVOLUTION OF THE JURIDICAL THOUGHT IN THE TRANSITION FROM LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM - IDENTIFIABLE WITH THE NINETEENTH-CENTURY THEORIES OF THE "RULE OF LAW" - TO DEMOCRATIC-SOCIAL CONSTITUTIONALISM THAT INSPIRES AND SHAPES THE "WELFARE STATE". IN SHORT, DEMOCRATIC-SOCIAL CONSTITUTIONALISM CAN BE VIEWED AS THE FUNDAMENTAL CORE OF THE SOCIAL PACT THROUGH WHICH THE EUROPEAN AND WESTERN CIVILISATION MANAGES TO PROVIDE A DEMOCRATIC ALTERNATIVE TO THE DISINTEGRATION OF THE LIBERAL STATES. THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE NEW CONSTITUTIONALISM WILL BE ANALYZED BY FOCUSING ON WHAT, IN OUR OPINION, CAN BE CONSIDERED ITS MAIN "PILLARS".
857	THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONS AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE BANKING SYSTEM ON THE COST OF DEBT FOR A SAMPLE OF FIRMS FROM 37 COUNTRIES. THE COST OF DEBT DECREASES WITH THE RULE OF LAW, THE PROTECTION OF CREDITORS' RIGHTS AND THE WEIGHT OF BANKS IN THE ECONOMY. BANK FINANCING AND BANK CONCENTRATION HAVE A POSITIVE DIFFERENTIAL EFFECT ON THE COST OF DEBT IN THOSE COUNTRIES WHERE THE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OF BANKS ARE GREATER. LEGAL ENFORCEMENT, THE PROTECTION OF CREDITORS' RIGHTS AND THE WEIGHT OF BANK FINANCING HAVE A GREATER INFLUENCE IN COUNTRIES WITH A LOWER DEGREE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.
858	WHETHER OR NOT ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND CAPITALISM ARE ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER OR WORSE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE GIVES RISE TO A HEATED POLITICAL DEBATE. THIS ARTICLE SHEDS EMPIRICAL LIGHT ON THE DEBATE BY EXAMINING THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL FREEDOM ON THE ONE HAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE ON THE OTHER. ESTIMATING THE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY ON FOUR ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURES SINCE 1993 ACROSS 27 FORMERLY COMMUNIST COUNTRIES SHOWS THAT LIBERALISING THE SIZE OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR IS ASSOCIATED WITH LESS ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, ALTHOUGH ONLY IN AUTOCRACIES. THE CONSEQUENCES OF REGULATORY ACTIVITY, MARKET OPENNESS AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE MORE MIXED.
859	DESCRIBES THE PROCESS THROUGH WHICH CHINA HAS REBUILT AND STRENGTHENED ITS BUREAUCRACY SINCE 1978 WITHOUT MOVING TOWARD RULE OF LAW. INTERNALLY, THE BUREAUCRACY HAS BECOME MORE RULE-GOVERNED, AND NEW PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED, INCLUDING REGULAR RULES FOR PROMOTION, CREDENTIALING, AND TURNOVER, INCLUDING TERM LIMITS. HOWEVER, EXTERNAL ACCOUNTABILITY IS ABSENT. THE HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "INSIDE" AND "OUTSIDE" MAY BE A UNIQUE FEATURE OF THE CHINESE SYSTEM. JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS 44 (2) (2016) 404-415. SCHOOL OF GLOBAL POLICY AND STRATEGY (GPS), UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO, USA. (C) 2015 ASSOCIATION FOR COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC STUDIES. PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
860	CONSTITUTIONALISM, RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY HAVE TAKEN ROOT IN INDIA DESPITE THE COLONIAL ANTECEDENTS OF THESE INSTITUTIONAL FORMS. THEY ARE CURRENTLY UNDER STRAIN, OWING TO THE CHALLENGES THROWN UP BY A DIVERSE, MULTICULTURAL POLITY. THE JUDICIARY, WHICH HAS BEEN GIVEN VAST POWERS, RUNS THE RISK OF BECOMING POLITICIZED, WHILE SEVERAL CONTENTIOUS ISSUES IN POLITICS WHICH SHOULD BE RESOLVED BY DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES ARE CONVERTED INTO QUESTIONS OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. ALTHOUGH THESE INSTITUTIONAL FORMS HAVE THEIR LIMITS, A PROCESS OF INCREASING DEMOCRACY AND DECENTRALIZATION OF GOVERNANCE PROVIDES GROUNDS FOR OPTIMISM ABOUT INDIA'S FUTURE AS A CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY.
861	MOBILE APPS HAVE PROLIFERATED ONLINE IN RECENT YEARS, BUT RELATED FORMAL RESEARCH HAS LAGGED BEHIND. USING DATA ON A LARGE SAMPLE OF NATIONS OVER THE YEARS 2018-2020, WE ESTIMATE THE DRIVERS OF MOBILE APP PRODUCTION. RESULTS SHOW THAT MORE MOBILE SUBSCRIBERS (CAPTURING DEMAND-PULL EFFECTS) INCREASE MOBILE APP PRODUCTION. HOWEVER, OVERALL E-PARTICIPATION FAILS TO EXERT A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE. BOTH FDI INFLOWS AND ICT IMPORTS CONTRIBUTE TO MOBILE APP PRODUCTION, AS DO THE INPUTS AND OUTPUTS OF OVERALL TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE (PATENTS, RESEARCHERS, AND KNOWLEDGE WORKERS). THESE RESULTS CONTRAST WITH THE (MOSTLY INSIGNIFICANT) RESULTS FOR CAPITAL FORMATION AND THE RULE OF LAW.
862	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE EFFORTS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION NETWORK (EPIL NETWORK) TO UNDERSTAND HOW CHINESE ENVIRONMENTAL CIVIL SOCIETY PROACTIVELY CREATED A NETWORK TO MOBILIZE RESOURCES, FORGE COLLABORATIVE ACTIONS, AND BUILD CAPACITIES AND FOSTER WISDOM TO CATALYZE CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW AND IN THE AREA OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT. USING CIVIL SOCIETY NETWORK ANALYSIS, THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO IDENTIFY AND ACCOUNT FOR INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE EPIL NETWORK AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING THE GOVERNMENT. FINALLY, THE STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE EPIL NETWORK, WHICH PROVIDES AN OPTION FOR RESOLVING POLITICAL CONFLICTS IN CHINA REGARDING MUNICIPAL WASTE MANAGEMENT.
863	THIS PAPER HIGHLIGHTS DEFICIENCIES IN UGANDA'S NATIONAL SECURITY CIVILIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES' OVERSIGHT SYSTEMS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE OF THE SECURITY SECTOR. IT ARGUES THAT THE INTELLIGENCE SUB-SECTOR IN UGANDA STILL LAGS BEHIND AS FAR AS ADHERING TO DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE NORMS IS CONCERNED. THE LEGISLATURE AND CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO ENSURE THAT INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATIONS OPERATE WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW FIND VERITABLE CHALLENGES DUE TO SOME LEGISLATIVE AMBIGUITIES. THE PAPER RECOMMENDS THAT THE LAWS GOVERNING INTELLIGENCE SERVICES SHOULD BE AMENDED TO GIVE MORE DEFINITE MANDATES TO THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHER OVERSIGHT BODIES.
864	THE PROCEDURAL LEGAL NORMS PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN ENSURING OPTIMAL CONDITIONS FOR LEGAL REGULATION, BEAR THE MAIN BURDEN OF THE NORMATIVE WAY OF STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW, ENSURING THE RIGHTS, FREEDOMS AND LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OF CITIZENS. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE TRENDS IN THE PROCEDURAL LAW DEVELOPMENT AS AN INDEPENDENT LEGAL UNIT, TO PREDICT WAYS OF OPTIMIZING AND UNIFYING CERTAIN PROCESS TYPES IN DIFFERENT LEGAL FAMILIES WITHOUT A HISTORICAL EXCURSION. WE OFFERED VARIOUS APPROACHES TO THE PERIODIZATION OF THE PROCEDURAL LAW DEVELOPMENT, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FEATURES AND THE DIFFERENCES OF LEGAL SYSTEMS.
865	POLICE CORRUPTION HAS EMERGED AS A SERIOUS SECURITY CHALLENGE IN KENYA. WHERE POLICE CORRUPTION IS PERSISTENT, IT REPRESENTS A SYSTEMIC FAILURE OF GOVERNANCE IN WHICH THE PRINCIPAL INSTITUTIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING POLICE GOVERNANCE, THE OBSERVANCE OF ETHICS AND INTEGRITY STANDARDS, AND ENFORCING THE RULE OF LAW ARE COMPROMISED AND MAY THEMSELVES BE INFESTED WITH CORRUPT INDIVIDUALS AND SYNDICATES. THIS WORK DISCUSSES AND PROVIDES AN ANALYTICAL SURVEY OF POLICE CORRUPTION IN KENYA, DRAWING ON THE AVAILABLE DATA TO PROVIDE A COHERENT PICTURE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM AND ITS LINK TO, INFLUENCE ON, AND IMPLICATIONS FOR NATIONAL SECURITY IN THE COUNTRY.
866	IN 2011 THE HEADS OF STATE OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC) DISBANDED THE SADC TRIBUNAL AFTER THE REGIONAL COURT HELD THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT'S LAND SEIZURES VIOLATED THE RULE OF LAW. THE DISBANDMENT REFLECTS SADC'S HIERARCHY OF VALUES, IN TERMS OF WHICH THE ORGANIZATION'S FORMAL COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND A REGIONAL LEGAL ORDER IS SUBORDINATE TO THE POLITICAL IMPERATIVES OF REGIME SOLIDARITY AND RESPECT FOR SOVEREIGNTY. THE TRIBUNAL SAGA DEMONSTRATES THAT THE JURISDICTION OF REGIONAL COURTS DERIVES NOT SIMPLY FROM THEIR OFFICIAL MANDATES BUT FROM AN INTERPLAY BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND REGIONAL LAW AND POLITICS.
867	LAOS IS AN UNDER-RESEARCHED STATE, AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IS AN ESPECIALLY UNDER-RESEARCHED TOPIC. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD EXAMINE: THE EXTENT TO WHICH EXPERIENCES WITH THE FREE MARKET (ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT), DIVERSE SOURCES OF INFORMATION, FOREIGN EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES, AND RELIGIOUS PLURALISM ARE PREPARING THE GROUND FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN LAOS; THE UNDERSTANDING OF, AND RESPONSE TO, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM WITHIN THE MINORITY RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES; AND THE MEANING AND ROLE OF INDIVIDUALISTIC CONCEPTIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN GENERAL, AND INDIVIDUAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY IN PARTICULAR, FOR SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTS THAT EMPHASIZE THE FAMILY, COMMUNITY, AND NATION OVER THE INDIVIDUAL.
868	AGGREGATE INDEXES OF THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE, COVERING LARGE SAMPLES OF COUNTRIES, HAVE BECOME POPULAR IN COMPARATIVE POLITICAL ANALYSIS. FEW STUDIES EXAMINE THE VALIDITY OR RELIABILITY OF THESE INDEXES. TO PARTIALLY FILL THIS GAP, THIS STUDY USES FACTOR, CONFIRMATORY FACTOR AND PATH ANALYSIS TO TEST BOTH MEASUREMENT AND CAUSAL MODELS OF THE SIX WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS. THEY PURPORTEDLY MEASURE DISTINCT CONCEPTS OF CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, RULE OF LAW, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE QUALITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. RATHER THAN DISTINGUISHING AMONG ASPECTS OF THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE, WE FIND THAT THEY APPEAR TO BE MEASURING THE SAME BROAD CONCEPT.
869	THE PAPER FOCUSES ON COMPETITION POLICY, WHICH IS AT THE CENTER OF ORDOLIBERAL THINKING. IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS ARE THE EMPHASIS ON INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM, FROM WHICH THE GOAL OF ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY IS MERELY DERIVED; THE STRONG ROLE FOR THE STATE IN THE PRESERVATION OF THE PREREQUISITES OF COMPETITION, COMBINED WITH A RESERVE TOWARDS INTERVENTION BY GOVERNMENT IN MARKET PRICES; THE RULE OF LAW RATHER THAN DISCRETIONARY DECISIONS; AND THE EMBEDDING IN THE ECONOMIC ORDER OF A FREE AND OPEN SOCIETY. OTHER VIEWS (IMPOSSIBILITY OF COMPETITION, USELESSNESS OF COMPETITION LAW, SELECTIVE INTERVENTION) ARE CONTRASTED IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN THESE CHARACTERISTICS.
870	DOES A DOMESTIC CONSTITUTIONAL COURT WITHIN A STATE ENCOURAGE GREATER ACCEPTANCE OF THE JURISDICTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE (ICJ)? THIS QUESTION IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT IN ISLAMIC LAW STATES (ILS). ONE MIGHT EXPECT THAT ILS, WHICH EMBRACE THE RULE OF LAW DOMESTICALLY, MIGHT DO SO INTERNATIONALLY. HOWEVER, THIS EXPECTATION PAINTS AN OVERLY SIMPLISTIC PICTURE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S ROLE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICS. EMPLOYING ORIGINAL DATA ON CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENCES TO CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS (1946-2012), WE SHOW THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF ILS, ACCEPTANCE OF THE ICJ'S JURISDICTION IS CONDITIONAL ON AN INDEPENDENT CONSTITUTIONAL COURT.
871	TO ACT MERCIFULLY IS TO DO MORE THAN WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR JUSTICE. THE ACT APPEARS AS A POSITIVE EXCEPTION TO THE RULE OF LAW, AND THUS EXHIBITS AN INTENTIONALITY IRREDUCIBLE TO CONSCIOUSNESS OF A SOCIAL OR POLITICAL ORDER. IN THIS PHILOSOPHY OF LEVINAS, OCCASIONAL REFERENCES TO MERCY SHED SOME LIGHT ON THE GOODNESS OF THE GOOD THAT IS OTHERWISE OCDUDED BY OVERT CONCENTRATION ON SOCIAL OR POLITICAL JUSTICE. HOWEVER, LEVINAS'S ACCOUNT OF THE ACT ITSELF IS NOT ENTIRELY CONVINCING, AND ATTEMPTS TO IMPROVE UPON IT LEAD TOWARD A DIFFERENT CONCEPTION OF BEING AND NATURE THAN ONE FINDS IN HIS WORKS.
872	THIS ESSAY SUGGESTS THAT MOZART'S SERIOUS OPERA LA CLEMENZA DI TITO ENCAPSULATES BOTH A POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND A THEOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY, WHICH REFLECT THE COMPOSER'S DUAL COMMITMENTS TO THE LATE ENLIGHTENMENT AND CATHOLICISM. I ARGUE THAT THE OPERA ADVOCATES FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND SPECIFICALLY FOR A RENEWED (BECCARIAN) UNDERSTANDING OF CLEMENCY AS GENERAL LENIENCE IN PUNISHING RATHER THAN AS THE ABSOLUTE RULER'S EXTRAORDINARY USE OF PARDONS BASED IN HIS LIBERUM ARBITRIUM. AT THE SAME TIME, MOZART'S CLEMENZA OFFERS THE AUDIENCE A CHRISTIAN ACCOUNT OF THE JOURNEY FROM CONCUPISCENCE AND SIN TO SALVATION, CAUSED BY MERCY, LOVE, AND SUFFERING.
873	RUTH WARD EXPLAINS HOW OPEN ACCESS TO LEGISLATION IN AFRICA IS A MUCH MORE RECENT DEVELOPMENT THAN IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD. SEVERAL RECENTLY LAUNCHED PROJECTS ARE WELL UNDERWAY, AND ARE CONTRIBUTING TOWARDS PROMOTING JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW IN AFRICA. ACCESS TO LEGISLATION FACILITATES GREAT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCESS TO THE LAW FOR THE PROMOTION OF TRADE AND INVESTMENT; AND SUPPORTS THE RESULTING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ON THE CONTINENT. SEVERAL DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO ESTABLISHING PROJECTS WHICH DELIVER RELIABLE CONSOLIDATED ACCESS TO LEGISLATION ARE ILLUSTRATED, AND SHOW THAT SUCCESSFUL PROJECTS CAN BE ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINED ON MODEST BUDGETS BY VERY SMALL TEAMS.
874	INTEGRATING EVOLUTIONARY GAME THEORY WITH MODERN POLITICAL ECONOMICS, THIS ARTICLE DEVELOPS A LOTKA-VOLTERRA EVOLUTIONARY MODEL TO EXPLAIN CHINA'S INCREMENTAL INSTITUTIONAL REFORM. IN THIS MODEL, GROWTH-ORIENTED CENTRAL LEADERS ARE INTELLIGENT DESIGNERS OF INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES; PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL LEADERS ARE POTENTIAL PREDATORS; AND PRIVATE FIRMS ARE POTENTIAL PREY. THIS MODEL FINDS THAT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE RULE OF LAW AND IN THE PROTECTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE NOT ESSENTIAL FOR SHORT-RUN GROWTH IN CHINA. INSTEAD, THE PRIMARY INSTITUTIONAL SOURCE OF CHINA'S ECONOMIC SUCCESS IS THE INCREMENTAL REDUCTIONS OF DISCRIMINATION POLICY AGAINST THE PRIVATE SECTOR.
875	IN CANADA OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A VIGOROUS CONTROVERSY AS TO THE MEASURES NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THE USE OF ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION WHICH, IN LIGHT OF ITS INDEFINITE DURATION AND THE SEVERITY OF THE CONDITIONS, IS THE MOST RESTRICTIVE FORM OF IMPRISONMENT - IS CONSISTENT WITH HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS AND SUBJECT TO THE RULE OF LAW. ONE OF THESE MEASURES IS INDEPENDENT ADJUDICATION. THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE HISTORY OF INDEPENDENT ADJUDICATION IN FEDERAL CORRECTIONS, THE UNDERLYING ISSUES OF LEGAL PRINCIPLE AND OPERATIONAL REALITY, AND THE COMPETING ARGUMENTS SURROUNDING ITS IMPLEMENTATION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION.
876	THE UK'S EXIT FROM THE EU HAS REVITALIZED THE DEBATE ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION AND THE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF THE ECHR AND THE COMMON LAW. IT IS INFLUENCED BY THE TENDENCY PREVALENT AMONG KEY POLICY MAKERS WHICH HAS LED TO NON-COMPLIANCE WITH STRASBOURG COURT JUDGMENTS BEING CONSIDERED OR ARGUMENTS FOR WITHDRAWAL FROM THE CONVENTION BEING JUSTIFIED ON THE BASIS THAT BRITISH TRADITIONS AND INSTITUTIONS ARE SUPERIOR. THE WAY IN WHICH THE SUPREME COURT HAS CHOSEN TO PROTECT CONVENTION RIGHTS LOCATES ITS CURRENT APPROACH TO HUMAN RIGHTS WITHIN THE WIDER DEBATE ON THE MEANING OF THE RULE OF LAW.
877	THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE LEGALITY AND LEGITIMACY OF THE JUDICIARY'S PUBLIC POLICIES CONCERNING ACCESS TO JUSTICE. WITH PUBLIC POLICIES' MEETING OF EFFICIENCY TARGETS ESSENTIAL IN A WELFARE STATE, A NEO-CONSTITUTIONALIST PERSPECTIVE FRAMES THE ENTIRE SET OF CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARDS GUARANTEEING FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AS MANDATORY REGULATIONS FOR THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATOR. UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, THE JUDICIARY PLAYS AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN THE SUPERVISION OF PUBLIC POLICIES. ALONG WITH THE BUDGETS FOR THE VARIOUS STATE JUDICIARY BRANCHES, THE PRINCIPLE OF EFFICIENCY GUIDING PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION THEREFORE CREATES A NEW CONCEPT IN THE FIELD OF PUBLIC POLICIES: THE PUBLIC POLICIES OF THE JUDICIARY.
878	WESTERN AND INTERNATIONAL DEMOCRATIZATION PROJECTS IN THE ARAB WORLD, AS ELSEWHERE, HAVE BEEN CONTROVERSIAL MAINLY BECAUSE, UNLIKE TRADITIONAL FOREIGN AID THROUGH GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT CHANNELS THAT STRENGTHENED EXECUTIVE INSTITUTIONS, PROJECTS IN THE FIELDS OF ELECTIONS, RULE OF LAW, AND CIVIL SOCIETY ARE FUNDED AND EXECUTED PRINCIPALLY THROUGH EXTRA-GOVERNMENTAL CHANNELS. WHILE FOREIGN DEMOCRACY BROKERS SUCCESSFULLY CULTIVATED RELATIONSHIPS WITH SOME LIBERAL THINK-TANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS DURING THE 1990S, THERE WAS ALSO A POLITICAL BACKLASH AS ARAB GOVERNMENTS ATTEMPTED TO RESTORE THEIR MONOPOLIES OVERFOREIGN FUNDING AND THE PRODUCTION OF POLITICAL INFORMATION. L THE LAST DECADE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY.
879	THIS ARTICLE RECALLS AND RECOUNTS NASSER HUSSAIN'S UNIQUE MANNER OF THINKING. FOCUSING ON SEVERAL TEXTS THAT REFLECT THE EXTRAORDINARY RANGE OF HIS CURIOSITY AND ERUDITION - THE BOOK THE JURISPRUDENCE OF EMERGENCY: COLONIALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW (2003), AND TWO ARTICLES, "HYPERLEGALITY" (2007), AND "THE SOUND OF TERROR: PHENOMENOLOGY OF A DRONE STRIKE" (2013), AS WELL AS A CO-AUTHORED AMICI CURIAE BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS IN THE CASE OF KIOBEL V. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO. (2011) - THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THREE AREAS WHERE HUSSAIN'S WORK MAKES THE GREATEST IMPACT: HISTORY, JURISPRUDENCE, AND CRITIQUE.
880	THE PRESENT ARTICLE EXPLORES THE REACTION OF QUITO'S TOWN COUNCIL TO THE PASTO CAMPAIGN IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE INCORPORATION OF THE PROVINCE OF QUITO INTO THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA. ESTABLISHMENT OF A REPUBLICAN ORDER BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW SUPERSEDED PREEXISTING MUNICIPAL SOVEREIGNTY BASED ON TRADITION, CUSTOMARY LAWS, AND THE EXERCISE OF JUDICIAL JUSTICE. THE USE OF SPECIAL POWERS AS PROVIDED FOR IN THE CONSTITUTION OF CUCUTA TO GOVERN TERRITORIES AT WAR LED TO DISPUTES BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENTAL GOVERNOR VICENTE AGUIRRE AND THE TOWN COUNCIL FOR USE OF ITS REVENUES AND THE LEVY OF COMPULSORY CONTRIBUTIONS.
881	IN EARLY PUBLIC LAND PRIVATIZATION, GOVERNMENTS IN NEW SOUTH WALES AND BUENOS AIRES PROVIDED FOR DE JURE TRANSFER OF PUBLIC LANDS. IN NEW SOUTH WALES THE GOVERNMENT LOST CONTROL; SQUATTERS RUSHED OUT UNLAWFULLY AND SEIZED DE FACTO FRONTIER CLAIMS. BUT IN BUENOS AIRES PRIVATIZATION WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY DE JURE TRANSFERS. WHY DID BRITISH SETTLERS REJECT DE JURE TRANSFERS FROM A GOVERNMENT, MOST ABLE TO SECURE PROPERTY RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW, WHILE SETTLERS OF THE PAMPA FRONTIER, WHERE PROPERTY-RIGHTS SECURITY WAS DOUBTFUL, COMPLIED WITH DE JURE TRANSFERS? WE FIND THAT THE REVENUE OBJECTIVE AND VIOLENCE ON THE FRONTIER EXPLAIN THIS PUZZLE.
882	THROUGH A DETAILED RECONSTRUCTION OF 1933 GDP FOR THE TWO PROVINCES IN CHINA'S MOST ADVANCED REGION, THE LOWER YANGZI, I SHOW THAT THEIR PER CAPITA INCOME WAS 55 PERCENT HIGHER THAN CHINA'S AVERAGE, AND THEY HAD EXPERIENCED A GROWTH AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE BETWEEN 1914-1918 AND 1931-1936 COMPARABLE TO CONTEMPORANEOUS JAPAN AND HER EAST ASIAN COLONIES. THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE UNIQUE POLITICAL INSTITUTION OF EARLY-TWENTIETH-CENTURY SHANGHAI AS A CITY STATE, WITH ITS RULE OF LAW AND SECURE PROPERTY RIGHTS LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE LOWER YANGZI WITH LONG-TERM IMPACT THROUGHOUT EAST ASIA.
883	WE PRESENT NEW EVIDENCE ON HOW GENERALIZED TRUST IS FORMED. UNLIKE PREVIOUS STUDIES, WE LOOK AT THE EXPLANATORY POWER OF ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS, WE USE NEWER DATA, WE INCORPORATE MORE COUNTRIES, AND WE USE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES IN AN ATTEMPT TO HANDLE THE CAUSALITY PROBLEM. A CENTRAL RESULT IS THAT LEGAL STRUCTURE AND SECURITY OF PROPERTY RIGHTS (AREA 2 OF THE ECONOMIC FREEDOM INDEX) INCREASE TRUST. THE IDEA IS THAT A MARKET ECONOMY, BUILDING ON VOLUNTARY TRANSACTIONS AND INTERACTIONS WITH BOTH FRIENDS AND STRANGERS WITHIN THE PREDICTABILITY PROVIDED BY THE RULE OF LAW, ENTAILS BOTH INCENTIVES AND MECHANISMS FOR TRUST TO EMERGE BETWEEN PEOPLE.
884	THE PRESENT PAPER HOD AS MAIN OBJECTIVE TO MAKE A BRIEF APPROACH ON THE EDUCATION FINANCING POLICY IN BRAZIL AND THE STATE OF TOCANTINS, WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. IT IS A QUALITATIVE RESEARCH, AND TECHNIQUES OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC REVIEW, DOCUMENTARY AND LEGAL ANALYSIS WERE USED. THE MAIN AUTHORS USED TO THEORETICALLY SUPPORT THE STUDY WERE: SAVIANI; LYRA-SILVA; DOURADO ET AL .; DAVIES, FERREIRA AND CARVALHO; ABOVE ALL, HISTORICAL-CRITICAL PEDAGOGY WAS USED, WHICH IS BASED ON A DIALECTICAL APPROACH AND CONCEIVES MAN AS A SOCIAL BEING UNDER CONSTRUCTION, WHICH IS HISTORICALLY CONSTITUTED FROM THE APPROPRIATION OF HUMANIZED CULTURE.
885	THE WORK AIMS AT DEMONSTRATING THE CRITICAL JUNCTURE IN WHICH BRAZIL HAS IMMERSED SINCE 2013 WITH STREET PROTESTS, INCLUDING THE 2014 ELECTION OPERATION CAR WASH, PRESIDENT DILMA'S IMPEACHMENT, WHICH CULMINATED IN THE ELECTION OF BOLSONARO. THE ELEMENTS OF THIS SITUATION ARE MORE RELATED TO A DISPUTE BETWEEN RIGHT- AND LEFT-WING POSITIONS, TO A CHARACTERIZED WAY OF LIFE AND CENTERED ON SOCIAL NETWORKS, WHERE POLITICS AND SOCIAL LIRE HAVE BEEN ENTHRONED. IN THIS SENSE, THE IDEA OF JUDICIALIZED POLITICS AND INSTITUTIONS AS ELEMENTS THAT GUARANTEE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND THE RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN CONFUSING AND MISINFORMING EVERYONE.
886	IN A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY AN INDEPENDENT JUSTICE SYSTEM PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS AT RISK FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT DERIVE FROM OUTSIDE THE SYTSEM AS WELL AS FROM WITHIN. THE EXTERNAL DANGERS FACING JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE ARE OFTEN DISCUSSED; WHEREAS THE INTERNAL PERILS THAT WEAKEN THE SYSTEM AS WELL AS JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, ARE FAR LESS KNOWN. THIS ARTICLE WILL FOCUS ON THE DANGER FROM WITHIN AND WILL DISCUSS THE JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION'S INFLUENCE ON HUMAN RIGHTS, SPECIFICALLY THE RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS UNDER THE LAW.
887	THE PENALTY PHASE IS THE FIRST AMERICAN MOTION PICTURE TO SHINE AN INFORMED AND HONEST LIGHT UPON THE PROFESSIONAL, POLITICAL, AND PERSONAL LIFE OF A TRIAL JUDGE. THIS ESSAY DISCUSSES THE TRANSFIGURATION OF THE STORY, FROM ITS INSPIRATION, THROUGH THE WRITING, REWRITING, CASTING, DIRECTING, AND FILMING OF THE MOTION PICTURE. AS WE FOLLOW THE FATED BATTLE OF JUDGE KENNETH HOFFMAN TO DEFEND THE RULE OF LAW AND AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY, WE ARE COMPELLED TO ASK, AS MUST HE, "HOW MUCH OF A PRICE ARE WE WILLING TO PAY FOR THE LIBERTIES AFFORDED US BY OUR LAWS AND OUR CONSTITUTION?"
888	THIS ARTICLE DRAWS ON TEXTUAL EVIDENCE FROM THE THEORY OF MORAL SENTIMENTS AND THE WEALTH OF NATIONS TO ADDRESS MISTAKEN INTERPRETATIONS OF ADAM SMITH'S FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT OF SELF-INTEREST AS GREED THAT HAS BEEN SAID TO HAVE HAD A CORROSIVE INFLUENCE ON MARKETS, COMMERCIAL BEHAVIOUR, AND WIDENING INEQUALITY. TO THE CONTRARY, SMITH'S COMPLEX SET OF HUMAN MOTIVATIONS, INCLUDING SELF-INTEREST, HIS ECONOMIC SYSTEM THAT IS BASED ON FREE MARKETS, AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS GOVERNING PRODUCTIVE PROPERTY RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE ARGUED TO INCREASE AGGREGATE WEALTH, IMPROVE THE POSITION OF THOSE LEAST WELL OFF, AND MAINTAIN ETHICAL SOCIAL ORDER.
889	IN THIS ARTICLE THE AUTHOR OFFERS A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS ON THE LEGITIMACY OF THE COMPLAINANT IN THE CURRENT FEDERAL CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE (ALSO KNOWN AS "LEVENE CODE"), IN THE CASE LAW OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ARGENTINA AND IN THE NEW CRIMINAL CODE (LAW 27.063). ON THAT BASIS, THE AUTHOR ALSO EXPLORES THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES REGARDING THE NEW ROLE OF THE COMPLAINANT AS AN AUTONOMOUS PARTY IN THE PROCEDURE AND INVITES THE READERS TO REFLECT ON THE CONVENIENCE OF THIS KIND OF REGULATION IN A SOCIETY GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW, RESPECTFUL OF THE RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED.
890	AUSTRALIAN COURTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNALS ARE DEPENDENT UPON GOVERNMENT FOR FUNDING. ADDITIONALLY, IN MOST CIRCUMSTANCES, COURTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNALS ARE DEPENDENT UPON GOVERNMENT FOR ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE. THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT, THE EXECUTIVE, THE LEGISLATIVE AND THE JUDICIAL BE SEPARATE. GIVEN THE DEPENDENCE ON FUNDING AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT, CAN AUSTRALIA'S COURTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNALS BE INDEPENDENT? THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES WHETHER THERE IS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ADMINISTRATIVE INDEPENDENCE AND ADJUDICATIVE INDEPENDENCE AND THEN PRESENTS THE VIEWS OF PARTICIPANTS GAINED FROM TWO SEPARATE SURVEYS ON THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ADMINISTRATIVE AND ADJUDICATIVE INDEPENDENCE.
891	TRADITIONAL AFRICAN SYSTEMS OF SOCIAL CONTROL TYPICALLY HAVE REVOLVED AROUND DEFERENCE TO CHIEFTAINCY AUTHORITIES. DURING THE COLONIAL PERIOD, DEVELOPMENTAL NEGLECT AND A SUBSISTENCE/FEUDAL MODE OF PRODUCTION IN BOTSWANA PRODUCED A MODEL OF CUSTOMARY SOCIAL CONTROL. SINCE INDEPENDENCE, HOWEVER, BOTSWANA HAS FORGED EXTRAORDINARY RATES OF ECONOMIC AND URBAN GROWTH PLACING STRAINS ON BOTH ITS ADHERENCE TO TRADITIONAL NORMS AND ITS ATTEMPT TO CONSTRUCT A POLICE INSTITUTION BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. DRAWING ON OFFICIAL DATA AND FIELD INTERVIEWS, THIS PAPER SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE CONSTRAINTS ENCOUNTERED IN ESTABLISHING THIRD WORLD DEMOCRATIC POLICE FORCES.
892	WE STUDY PROCUREMENT BRIBERY UTILIZING SURVEY DATA FROM 11,000 ENTERPRISES IN 125 COUNTRIES. ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF MANAGERS REPORT THAT FIRMS LIKE THEIRS BRIBE TO SECURE A PUBLIC CONTRACT, PAYING ABOUT 8 % OF THE CONTRACT VALUE. ECONOMETRIC ESTIMATIONS SUGGEST THAT NATIONAL GOVERNANCE FACTORS, SUCH AS DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY, PRESS FREEDOM, AND RULE OF LAW, ARE ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER BRIBERY. LARGER AND FOREIGN-OWNED FIRMS ARE LESS LIKELY TO BRIBE THAN SMALLER DOMESTIC ONES. BUT AMONG BRIBERS, FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC FIRMS PAY SIMILAR AMOUNTS. MULTINATIONAL FIRMS APPEAR SENSITIVE TO REPUTATIONAL RISKS IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES, BUT PARTIALLY ADAPT TO THEIR HOST COUNTRY ENVIRONMENTS.
893	OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS, DUNSMUIR V NEW BRUNSWICK HAS BECOME A FOCAL POINT IN SCHOLARLY AND JUDICIAL DISCOURSE REGARDING THE LAW OF JUDICIAL REVIEW. BUT, DESPITE ITS INFLUENTIAL STATUS, THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THE REASONING IN DUNSMUIR CANNOT BE EASILY RECONCILED WITH PARADIGMATIC CASES IN CANADIAN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, WHICH REGARD TRANSPARENCY, FAIRNESS, AND REASONED JUSTIFICATION AS ESSENTIAL RULE-OF-LAW SAFEGUARDS AGAINST ARBITRARY GOVERNMENTAL ACTION. BY JUXTAPOSING DUNSMUIR WITH A PRINCIPLED UNDERSTANDING OF THESE PARADIGMATIC CASES, THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT THE REASONING IN DUNSMUIR SERVES TO UNDERMINE, RATHER THAN REINFORCE, THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE ENSURE THE LEGITIMACY OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW.
894	PAST STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED THE SPREAD OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS AND WAVES OF DEMOCRATIZATION AS TWO MAJOR FORCES THAT FACILITATE HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION. LESS WELL-KNOWN IS THE PROCESS OF HOW LEGAL PROFESSIONALS EXPLOIT THESE MACRO-LEVEL OPPORTUNITIES TO PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS IN NEW DEMOCRACIES. IN THIS STUDY OF TORTURE IN SOUTH KOREA, I SHOW THAT THE PRACTICE OF TORTURE DISAPPEARED ONLY THROUGH THE EFFORTS OF LAWYERS AND JUDGES TO ESTABLISH THE RULE OF LAW. SPECIFICALLY, I IDENTIFY THREE REFORMS THAT ENHANCED ACCOUNTABILITY OF STATE AGENCIES: JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, LAWYERS' PARTICIPATION IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION.
895	USING HECKMAN'S SAMPLE SELECTION PROCEDURE, WE FIRST ANALYSE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET AND THEN SPECIFIC INTERNET USAGE GIVEN INDIVIDUAL INTERNET ACCESS, ACROSS THE EU COUNTRIES USING EUROBAROMETER DATA FOR 2004 AND 2005. INTERNET ACCESS VARIES MORE WITHIN COUNTRIES THAN BETWEEN THEM. BUT THE REVERSE IS THE CASE FOR INTERNET USAGE GIVEN ACCESS. TWO SPECIFIC COUNTRY ATTRIBUTES ARE IDENTIFIED: FIRST GROSS NATIONAL INCOME AND THE RULE OF LAW REFLECTING THE EXTENT TO WHICH PEOPLE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE SECURITY OF THE INTERNET. FURTHER VARIABLES ALSO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF TRUST. (C) 2009 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
896	THE VENEZUELAN CONSTITUTION IS ANALYZED IN THE LIGHT OF VALUE THEORIES. THE CONSTITUTION INCORPORATES A SET OF VALUES FOR PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW AND BOLIVARIAN THOUGHT. THE CONSTITUTION IMPLIES PROJECTUALITY AT LEVELS OF THE STATE, THE LAW AND SOCIETY, SINCE VALUES ARE THE LINKS THAT GUIDE INSTITUTIONAL PRAXIS AND SHAPE CONDITIONS OF LAW AND POLITICAL LEGITIMACY. THIS STUDY DESCRIBES THE DIMENSIONS OF THE VALUES IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THEIR IDEOLOGICAL AND PRAXEOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS. THE DOCUMENTARY ANALYSIS METHOD IS USED. CONCLUSIONS ARE THAT ONTOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL-CULTURAL THEORIES ARE AWARE OF THE BEING OF THE STATE AND OF DEMOCRATIC PRAXIS.
897	NO OTHER COUNTRY HAS TAKEN THE IDEA OF THE LIBERAL STATE - A GOVERNMENT THAT RELIES ON THE RULE OF LAW TO LIMIT STATE POWER AND MAXIMIZE INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY - AS SERIOUSLY AS THE UNITED STATES. BUT NOW MANY STATES ARE MANIPULATING THE GOVERNMENT'S CIVIL COMMITMENT AUTHORITY TO INDEFINITELY CONFINE SEX OFFENDERS WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR CRIMINAL SENTENCES AND ARE ENTITLED TO THEIR FREEDOM IN THE COMMUNITY. THIS NEW SYSTEM OF PREVENTIVE DETENTION MASQUERADING AS CIVIL COMMITMENT POSES AN OMINOUS THREAT TO INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND TO THE CONTINUED VITALITY OF THE LIBERAL STATE. (C) 2008 ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
898	CRIMINAL-STATES AND CRIMINAL-SOLDIERS ARE TWO INTERRELATED THREATS THAT CHALLENGE ORDER AND STABILITY AT LOCAL, NATIONAL, AND POTENTIALLY GLOBAL LEVELS. POLICING AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE ESSENTIAL TO SECURING THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR STABLE GOVERNANCE AND PRESERVING THE RULE OF LAW. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND POLICE SERVICES PLAY KEY ROLES IN ENSURING COMMUNITY STABILITY. THEY ALSO CONTROL AND CONTAIN CRIMINAL THREATS, PROTECT INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES, AND ENABLE OTHER POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC PROCESSES TO FUNCTION. THIS AFTERWARD EXAMINES THE ROLE OF POLICE AND ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN COUNTERING THE THREATS POSED BY CRIMINAL-SOLDIERS IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE ESTABLISHMENT OR SPREAD OF CRIMINAL-STATES.
899	THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY AND LAW BEGAN WITH AN AVOWED FOCUS ON SOCIAL JUSTICE. IN THE PAST TWO DECADES, THAT FOCUS HAS BEEN DIVERTED. WITH JUSTICE DEFINED MORE NARROWLY THAN PREVIOUSLY, PSYCHOLEGAL RESEARCH HAS CONTRIBUTED TO FALSE CONSCIOUSNESS ABOUT THE DEGREE TO WHICH LAW REDUCES INJUSTICE AND PROMOTES SOCIAL CHANGE. PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF FALSE CONSCIOUSNESS ABOUT LAW INCLUDE THE BELIEF THAT PROCEDURAL JUSTICE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN SUBSTANTIVE OR DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE, THE ACCEPTANCE OF LEGAL DOCTRINES THAT SUPPORT CORPORATE CAPITALISM, AND THE BELIEF THAT THE STRICT RULE OF LAW IS INHERENTLY SUPERIOR TO INDIVIDUALIZED EQUITY AND COMMONSENSE JUSTICE.
900	AN ASSESSMENT OF THE WORK OF THE JANUARY 6TH COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING THE ASSAULT ON THE U.S. CAPITOL IN JANUARY 2021. THE COMMENTARY ADDRESSES THE COMMITTEE'S WORK AS AN EXERCISE IN INSTITUTIONALIST ANTI-POPULISM THAT SEEKS TO DISRUPT THE POPULIST, TRUMPIST NARRATIVE BY INSISTING ON THE RULE OF LAW, THE POWER OF EXPERTISE, AND THE VALUE OF NORMS IN MAINTAINING A LIBERAL, DEMOCRATIC ORDER. IT OFFERS AN ANALYSIS OF HOW THE COMMITTEE'S WORK MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEMISE OF THE TRUMPIST SOCIAL MOVEMENT, ADDING POSSIBLE LINES OF ANALYSIS TO THE POPULIST PHENOMENON GOING FORWARD.
901	THE WORK AIMS AT DEMONSTRATING THE CRITICAL JUNCTURE IN WHICH BRAZIL HAS IMMERSED SINCE 2013 WITH STREET PROTESTS, INCLUDING THE 2014 ELECTION, OPERATION CAR WASH, PRESIDENT DILMA'S IMPEACHMENT, WHICH CULMINATED IN THE ELECTION OF BOLSONARO. THE ELEMENTS OF THIS SITUATION ARE MORE RELATED TO A DISPUTE BETWEEN RIGHT- AND LEFT-WING POSITIONS, TO A CHARACTERIZED WAY OF LIFE AND CENTERED ON SOCIAL NETWORKS, WHERE POLITICS AND SOCIAL LIFE HAVE BEEN ENTHRONED. IN THIS SENSE, THE IDEA OF JUDICIALIZED POLITICS AND INSTITUTIONS AS ELEMENTS THAT GUARANTEE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND THE RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN CONFUSING AND MISINFORMING EVERYONE.
902	CHINA IS A MAJOR FUNDER OF DEVELOPING COUNTRY INFRASTRUCTURE, LENDING $40 BILLION ANNUALLY THROUGH POLICY BANKS. LENDING DOES NOT FAVOR THE BELT AND ROAD ABOVE OTHER REGIONS. CHINA'S LENDING IS INDIFFERENT TO RISK, THAT IS, IT IS UNCORRELATED WITH INDICES OF POLITICAL STABILITY AND RULE OF LAW. SOME MAJOR BORROWERS WITH POOR GOVERNANCE ARE BEGINNING TO HAVE DEBT SUSTAINABILITY PROBLEMS, WHILE OTHER BORROWERS ARE IN GOOD FISCAL SHAPE. CHINESE BANKS HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO FOLLOW GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL NORMS BUT SEEM TO BE EVOLVING IN THAT DIRECTION. CHINESE ACTIONS SEEM MORE A REVISION OF THE GLOBAL SYSTEM THAN A CHALLENGE TO IT.
903	SCHOLARS SUCH AS FRIEDRICH HAYEK AND ALEKSANDER PECZENIK HAVE CRITICIZED LEGAL POSITIVISM FOR UNDERMINING CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW, AN IMPLICATION OF WHICH IS WEAKENED PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS. THIS CONCLUSION IS FAR FROM EVIDENT. FIRST, I CONTEND THAT LEGAL POSITIVISM IS COMPATIBLE WITH A STRONG SUPPORT FOR PROPERTY RIGHTS. SECOND, THE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEGAL POSITIVISM AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE APPLIED AND PROTECTED IS ANALYZED. THE MAIN ARGUMENTS FOR A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP-THAT LEGAL POSITIVISM CENTRALIZES AND POLITICIZES LEGISLATION AND THAT IT MAKES THE LEGAL CULTURE SERVILE IN RELATION TO THE POLITICAL SPHERE-ARE CONSIDERED UNCONVINCING.
904	THE AUTHOR FOCUSES ON THE LARGE NUMBER OF STRIKING AMERICAN LEGAL FILMS FROM THE LATE 1950S AND EARLY 1960S. HE ARGUES THAT THESE FILMS GLORIFIED LAWYERS, COURTROOM TRIALS, AND THE RULE OF LAW IN GENERAL, THEREBY DEPICTING A CINEMATIC IDEOLOGY. THIS PRODUCTION OF LAW-RELATED IDEOLOGY, THE AUTHOR SUGGESTS, DERIVED FROM NOT ONLY THE NATION'S LONG-STANDING LEGAL FAITH BUT ALSO FROM A DETERMINATION IN THE 1950S TO CONTRAST AMERICANISM WITH THE PERCEIVED COMMUNIST MENACE. FORTY YEARS LATER, THE FILMS REMAIN IMPORTANT CULTURAL EXEMPLARS AND ALSO ARTICULATIONS OF A POWERFUL IDEOLOGICAL PRESUMPTION REGARDING LAW IN AMERICAN LIFE.
905	THE WAR ON DRUGS HAS RESULTED IN SOME OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE CHANGES IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICY SINCE THE DUE PROCESS REVOLUTION OF THE 1960S. ASSET FORFEITURE HAS BEEN USED AS A CRIMINAL SANCTION BUT HAS BEEN CAMOUFLAGED AS A CIVIL PROCEDURE, THUS IN EFFECT LIMITING THE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS OF THOSE ACCUSED. THE STATE HAS EXTENDED ITS CONTROL OVER CITIZENS AND HAS SIMULTANEOUSLY WEAKENED THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST SLATE INTRUSION. THE POTENTIAL FOR EXCESS WITH A CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE POLICY ABSENT ADEQUATE DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS RENDER THIS POLICY UNACCEPTABLE IN A SOCIETY BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW.
906	IN HIS LATER DEPICTION OF AN IDEAL CITY, THE LAWS, PLATO DOES NOT MOVE FROM RULE BY EXPERTS TO THE RULE OF LAW, AS OFTEN CLAIMED, SINCE LAW IS ALSO BASIC TO THE REPUBLIC. RATHER, HE NOW SEES EDUCATED LAW-ABIDANCE AS PART OF CIVIC VIRTUE: THE LAWS ARE TO BE OBEYED STRICTLY, BUT ALSO TO BE UNDERSTOOD SO THAT THEY ARE OBEYED IN THE RIGHT SPIRIT. PLATO INTRODUCES ORIGINAL MEANS TO ENCOURAGE THIS, AND IS LED TO MAKE SOME MOVES IN THE DIRECTION OF WHAT WILL LATER BE DEVELOPED BY THE STOICS AS NATURAL LAW.
907	STARTING IN THE 1980S, AND ACCELERATING THROUGH THE 1990S, INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (IFIS), NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS (NGOS) AND DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES FUNNELLED CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES INTO JUDICIAL REFORM AND RULE OF LAW PROGRAMMES IN VIRTUALLY EVERY LATIN AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN COUNTRY. THE ASSUMPTION WAS THAT REFORMED COURT SYSTEMS WOULD FOSTER FREE MARKET ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF TWO FREQUENTLY ADVOCATED ASPECTS OF JUDICIAL REFORM, JUDICIAL ACCESS AND JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, ON ECONOMIC POLICY MAKING IN COSTA RICA. WE ARGUE THAT THERE IS A POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT DISJUNCTURE BETWEEN THE SPONSORS' EXPECTATIONS OF THE JUDICIAL REFORMS' ECONOMIC IMPACT AND THE OBSERVED OUTCOMES.
908	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN THE PUBLIC-PRIVATE INVESTMENT NEXUS USING A SAMPLE OF 37 SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT 2002-2018. THROUGH THE PANEL THRESHOLD REGRESSION, WE FOUND THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY MITIGATES THE CROWDING OUT EFFECT OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT ON PRIVATE INVESTMENT WHEN THE POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, RULE OF LAW, AND THE REGULATORY QUALITY RECORDS SCORE OVER 71.97, 50.54, 50.57 POINTS OUT OF 100, RESPECTIVELY. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PRIVATE INVESTMENT PROMOTION POLICIES THROUGH PUBLIC INVESTMENTS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS.
909	THE JUDICIAL DISCIPLINARY RESPONSIBILITY IS THE CONTROL OF THE ACTIVITY OF JUDGES AND MAGISTRATES, LEGAL INSTITUTION EXISTING IN ANY RULE OF LAW THAT BENEFITS SOCIETY AND THE STATE AS GUARANTOR OF THE JUDICIAL POWER. THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES MAKE THAT THE INFRACTIONS AND SANCTIONS ARE PREDETERMINED BY THE LAW, SO THAT THEY CAN BE IMPOSED ON THE JUDGES AND MAGISTRATES, THROUGH A FAIR PROCEDURE AND WITH ALL THE PROCEDURAL GUARANTEES. OUTSIDE THE ESSENCE OF THE INSTITUTION, THE SPANISH AND ITALIAN LEGAL SYSTEMS ARE MOSTLY DIVERGENT IN INFRACTIONS, SANCTIONS AND PROCESSING, DESPITE THE EXISTENCE OF CERTAIN SIMILARITIES IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL BODIES INVOLVED.
910	CLASSIC WESTERN FILMS OFTEN CONCEIVE OF THE WEST AS EXISTING IN A LEGAL VOID, WHERE THE CENTRAL CONFLICT IS A BINARY ONE BETWEEN LAWLESSNESS AND LEGALIZATION. THE LAW IS A MONOLITH, AND THE LEGALIZATION PROCESS IS LINEAR - A NARRATIVE OF THE WEST'S INEXORABLE EVOLUTION TOWARD A MODERN STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW. CIMINO'S HEAVEN'S GATE PRESENTS A MORE POSTMODERNIST, PLURALIST CONCEPTION. THERE IS NO GRAND NARRATIVE OF LEGALIZATION; THE FILM ENVISAGES A DISCOURSE OF JUSTICE EMERGING FROM THE INTERACTION OF A VARIETY OF DISCOURSES, AND WHICH APPEARS TO BE A UNITY ONLY FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF HISTORY.
911	NUMEROUS STUDIES EXAMINE THE IMPORTANCE OF LEGAL SYSTEMS, YET THERE IS LITTLE SCHOLARSHIP ON HOW NATIONS CAN IMPROVE THEIR LEGAL SYSTEMS. NATIONS MIGHT TRY TO INVEST MORE RESOURCES, INCLUDING INCREASING OVERALL BUDGETS, INCREASING JUDICIAL SALARIES, OR EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF JUDGES AND/OR COURTS. WE EXAMINE DATA FOR A SET OF EUROPEAN NATIONS, WITH A FOCUS ON THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO USE NATIONAL RESOURCES TO ENHANCE JUDICIAL QUALITY. WE CONSIDER THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT USES OF GOVERNMENT RESOURCES AND THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT JUDICIAL SYSTEMS ON MEASURES OF JUDICIAL QUALITY, INCLUDING INDEPENDENCE, EFFICIENCY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND PERCEIVED IMPARTIALITY.
912	DEFORESTATION PRIMARILY AFFECTS DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. MOST DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SHARE TWO CHARACTERISTICS: (1) TRADE LIBERALIZATION REFORMS IN THE LAST TWO DECADES, AND (2) WEAK PROPERTY RIGHTS AND LIMITED RULE OF LAW. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THIS SECOND-BEST WORLD,: FIRST, IN A STYLIZED MODEL IN WHICH TRADE DISTORTIONS ARE ELIMINATED IN AN ECONOMY WHOSE NATURAL RESOURCES ARE SUBJECT TO OPEN ACCESS; SECOND, EMPIRICALLY IN AN ESTIMATION EXERCISE THAT DISENTANGLES THE DIRECT EFFECT OF TRADE ON DEFORESTATION RATES AND AN INDIRECT EFFECT THROUGH ITS INTERACTION WITH OWNERSHIP SECURITY. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE THEORY, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ONLY THE INDIRECT EFFECT IS SIGNIFICANT.
913	IN THIS PAPER, WE EXAMINE THE CONSEQUENCES OF POPULIST GOVERNMENT FOR LONG-TERM ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. TO THIS END, WE ESTIMATE THE LONG-TERM GROWTH IMPACT OF THE JUAN PERON'S POLITICAL RULE IN ARGENTINA, WHICH LED TO A COMPREHENSIVE OVERHAUL OF THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK LAID BY THE ARGENTINE FOUNDING FATHERS IN THE 1853 CONSTITUTION. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE PROGRESSIVE SUBSTITUTION OF A GROWTH-ENHANCING INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK BY EXCLUSIONARY GROWTH-DISTORTING FRAMEWORKS EXPLAINS ARGENTINA'S ECONOMIC DECLINE FROM ONE THE WORLD'S RICHEST COUNTRIES ON THE EVE OF WORLD WAR I TO AN UNDERDEVELOPED NATION IN THE PRESENT DAY. WE EMPHASIZE THE EROSION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND RESTRAINT OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM DURING PERON'S FIRST GOVERNMENT (1943-1955) AS TWO FUNDAMENTAL COADJUTANT CAUSES OF ARGENTINA'S DECLINE. THE POPULIST LEGAL REFORMS OF PERON HAD LONG-LASTING ADVERSE ECONOMIC EFFECTS. BY COMPARING ARGENTINA'S PRE-PERON GROWTH TRAJECTORY WITH A DONOR POOL OF 58 COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 1860-2015, WE ESTIMATE THE COUNTERFACTUAL SCENARIO WITHOUT PERON'S REFORMS. A VARIETY OF SYNTHETIC CONTROL ESTIMATES UNCOVER SUBSTANTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THE WEAKENING OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE POPULIST REFORMS THAT BEGAN IN 1940S ON THE TRAJECTORY OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. THE POPULIST OVERHAUL NEGATED THE ECONOMIC GROWTH ADVANTAGES INHERENT IN THE 1853 ALBERDIAN CONSTITUTION. WITHOUT THE SHORT-SIGHTED POPULIST PERON EPISODES, ARGENTINA WOULD BE A RICH COUNTRY DOWN TO THE PRESENT DAY WITH PER CAPITA INCOME COMPARABLE TO SOUTHERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. WE ALSO PERFORM A SERIES OF RANDOMIZATION INFERENCES AND A BATTERY OF PLACEBO ANALYSES, WHICH CONFIRM OUR RESULTS.
914	THIS PAPER INQUIRES INTO THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE SECTION 810.01 "FEAR OF TERRORISM" OFFENCE THAT WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE CRIMINAL CODE UNDER THE ANTI-TERRORISM ACT, 2015 AMENDMENTS. ORDINARILY, CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND SENTENCING INTERSECT AT THE PUNISHMENT OF OFFENDERS FOR CRIMES THEY HAVE COMMITTED. HOWEVER, POST 9/11, IN REACTION TO THE FEAR OF TERRORISM, THE FOCUS HAS SHIFTED FROM PUNISHING PAST CRIMES TO CRIME PREVENTION. THAT IS, CERTAIN PREVENTATIVE MEASURES MAY BE IMPOSED IN THE ABSENCE OF A CHARGE, TRIAL OR CONVICTION. ARGUABLY, THE POWER TO DETAIN OR CONTROL THE MOVEMENTS OF PERSONS WITHOUT CHARGING THEM CHALLENGES THE SO-CALLED SACROSANCT NATURE OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS PAPER WILL UNFOLD IN THREE PARTS. PART ONE OUTLINES THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK RELATED TO PREVENTATIVE RECOGNIZANCES AND THE FEAR OF TERRORISM OFFENCE IN THE CRIMINAL CODE. PART TWO SURVEYS THE CASE LAW AND CONSIDERS CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS EVOKED BY THE CANADIAN CHARTER OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION PAID TO THE TENSION BETWEEN SECTION 810.01(3) RECOGNIZANCES AND THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE, ARBITRARY DETENTION AND THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT, CRIMINAL PROCEDURE AND THE RULE OF LAW PART THREE UNPACKS THE PREVENTATIVE/PUNITIVE DICHOTOMY WHICH IS THE RATIONALE UPON WHICH SECTION 810.01(3) RECOGNIZANCES ARE JUSTIFIED, BY ARGUING THAT RATHER THAN A PREVENTATIVE PROVISION, THEY ARE PUNITIVE SINCE, ARGUABLY, THEY CRIMINALIZE BEHAVIOUR THAT IS OTHERWISE LEGAL. THIS IS A DEPARTURE FROM THE POSITION TAKEN BY THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA. DISCLAIMER: THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN THIS PUBLICATION ARE THE AUTHOR'S OWN AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE VIEWS OF HER CURRENT EMPLOYER, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
915	FEDERAL LAWS PASSED SINCE THE 11 SEPTEMBER 2001 ATTACKS IN THE UNITED STATES REPRESENT AN EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION IN AUSTRALIA. THE LEGISLATIVE EROSION OF RIGHTS TRADITIONALLY ASSUMED AS BEING FUNDAMENTAL WITHIN COMMON LAW COUNTRIES LIES AT THE HEART OF THIS CHALLENGE. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES RECENTLY ADDED TO THE PACKAGE OF ANTI-TERRORISM LAWS: PREVENTATIVE DETENTION ORDERS; PROHIBITED CONTACT ORDERS; AND CONTROL ORDERS. THESE MEASURES WERE ADDED TO PART 5.3 OF THE SCHEDULE TO THE CRIMINAL CODE ACT 1995 (CTH) BY THE ANTI-TERRORISM ACT [NO 2] 2005 (CTH), AND DIRECTLY AND EXPLICITLY REMOVE OR INTERFERE WITHA NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. IN THIS ARTICLE WE ARGUE THAT THE THREAT TO HUMAN RIGHTS POSED BY SUCH MEASURES DERIVES NOT ONLY FROM THEIR LEGISLATIVE ENACTMENT AND FORM. THE THREAT IS HEIGHTENED BY THE DOMINANCE OF A POSITIVISTIC LEGALISM IN THE APPROACH OF THE HIGH COURT OF AUSTRALIA - AN APPROACH THAT TREATS THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT AS THE FOUNDATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN AUSTRALIA, AS OPPOSED TO THE SUPREME MANIFESTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT RESTS ON A BROADER, BUT LESS EXPLICIT, FOUNDATION OF CONSTITUTIONALISM. IN THIS RESPECT, THE PRESENCE OF A WRITTEN CONSTITUTION HAS HINDERED THE PROTECTION OF RIGHTS TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY OPERATES WITHIN A TEXTUAL STRAITJACKET. UNTIL SUCH TIME AS AUSTRALIA ADOPTS A BILL OF RIGHTS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, OR THERE OCCURS AN UNLIKELY SHIFT IN THE JURISPRUDENTIAL APPROACH OF THE HIGH COURT, THE COURT WILL HAVE LITTLE ROOM TO MANOEUVRE OUT OF ITS POSITIVISTIC CORNER WHEN FACED WITH OTHER EXTRAORDINARY LEGISLATIVE MEASURES.
916	THIS ARTICLE SUBMITS THAT THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) WILL SERVE AS A COMPLEMENTARY PROTECTION PROCESS TO THE ASEAN ARCHITECTURE ON HUMAN RIGHTS. SDG 16-PEACE, JUSTICE AND INCLUSIVE INSTITUTIONS-IS ESPECIALLY PERTINENT TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ALL OTHER SDG GOALS. THE LYNCHPIN OF THIS COMPLEMENTARITY IS THE ASEAN INTERGOVERNMENTAL COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS (AICHR), WHICH MUST BRIDGE ALL PARTS OF THE ARCHITECTURE. COMPLEMENTARITY STEMS FROM SEVERAL FACTORS. THE SDGS, NOTABLY GOAL 16, CREATED BRIDGES WITH HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS. ASEAN MEMBERS RESOUNDINGLY ENDORSED THE SDGS, INCLUDING SDG 16, WHICH OPERATES AS A DIALOGUE PROCESS THAT STATES ARE COMFORTABLE WITH. THE SDGS FIT WITH THE ASEAN COMMUNITY VISION 2025, WHICH EMPHASIZES STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY, GOOD GOVERNANCE, AND THE RULE OF LAW, THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS, AND COMBATING CORRUPTION TO RAISE THE STANDARD OF LIVING WITHIN THE REGION-ALL ELEMENTS OF SDG 16. ASEAN INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE ASEAN CHARTER ARE EQUIPPED TO UNDERTAKE PREVENTIVE DIPLOMACY TO HEAD OFF CONFLICTS, A FUNDAMENTAL AIM OF SDG 16. THE ASEAN INTERGOVERNMENTAL COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS CAN LEAD ON REFINING THE ECLECTIC SDG 16 INDICATORS TO BETTER ALIGN THEM WITH INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS. SDG 16 COMMITS ALL ASEAN STATES TO CREATING NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS. THE ELABORATION OF VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REPORTS UNDER THE SDG MONITORING PROCESS BEARS THE POTENTIAL FOR ENCOURAGING PARTICIPATION BY STAKEHOLDERS, ESPECIALLY CIVIL SOCIETY. THOUGH A POTENTIAL PITFALL, SECURITIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW COMPONENT OF SDG 16 IS CONSISTENT WITH ASEAN'S MODUS OPERANDI. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE NASCENT LITERATURE ON THE SDGS AND SDG 16 IN PARTICULAR.
917	THE FIRST PART OF THE ARTICLE PRESENTS THE LEGAL BASIS FOR THE PRINCIPLE OF PROTECTION OF ACQUIRED RIGHTS. THE AUTHOR INDICATES PROVISION OF CONSECUTIVE CONSTITUTIONAL ACTS FROM WHICH IT HAD BEEN DERIVED. HE REMARKS THAT THESE PROVISIONS ARE VERY GENERAL IN NATURE, AND THEIR NORMATIVE CONTENT, AS WELL AS THAT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PROTECTION OF ACQUIRED RIGHTS DERIVED THERE FROM, IS RECONSTRUCTED BY JURISPRUDENCE AND LITERATURE IN THE COURSE OF APPLICATION OF LAW. THE AUTHOR SYSTEMATISES THE VIEWS OF THE JUDICATURE AND LEGAL LITERATURE DOCTRINE WHICH TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE WAY IN WHICH THE NORM DEMANDING RESPECT FOR ACQUIRED RIGHTS HAD BEEN DERIVED.. HE ALSO PRESENTS HIS OWN APPROACH WHEN CONSIDERING A RELATION BETWEEN THE PRINCIPLE OF THE STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW AND THE PRINCIPLES OF PROTECTION OF ACQUIRED RIGHTS. HE GIVES THE REASONS WHY THE PRINCIPLE OF PROTECTION OF ACQUIRED RIGHTS EMANATES FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF THE STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW. THE FURTHER PART OF THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE NATURE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PROTECTION OF ACQUIRED RIGHTS, ITS NORMATIVE CONTENT. THE PRINCIPLE IS RECOGNISED IN LEGAL LITERATURE AS BOTH A GENERAL CLAUSE AND A PROGRAMME NORM. THE AUTHOR CRITICISES BOTH APPROACHES. THE CONCEPT OF RULES AND PRINCIPLES, DEVELOPED BY DWORKIN AND ALEXY, WITH APPROPRIATE MODIFICATIONS AND A AND ADJUSTED TO POLISH (POSITIVIST) SYSTEM OF LAW, SEEMS TO BE MORE USEFUL TO DESCRIBE THE CONTENT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PROTECTION OF ACQUIRED RIGHTS. BASED ON THIS CONCEPT, HE ARGUES THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF PROTECTION OF ACQUIRED RIGHTS IS AN OPTIMISATION NORM WHICH REQUIRES THE ACQUIRED RIGHTS BE PROTECTED AS FULLY AS POSSIBLE.
918	THE USE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS USES THE LEGAL SYSTEMS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE WORLD TO STRENGTHEN THE WAYS OF PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS PAPER EXAMINES CERTAIN PROBLEMS OF LEGAL REGULATION OF THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGIES IN ADMINISTRATIVE JUDICIAL PROCEDURE. THE METHODOLOGY OF THIS WORK IS BASED ON AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH USING COMPARATIVE LEGAL, DIALECTICAL AND SYSTEMIC METHODS. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO DETERMINE THE FORMS AND DIRECTIONS, RISKS AND BENEFITS, PROSPECTS FOR THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ADMINISTRATIVE JUDICIAL PROCEDURE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FOREIGN EXPERIENCE IN LEGAL REGULATION IN THIS AREA. THE CONCEPT OF "ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE" IS INVESTIGATED. IT IS EMPHASIZED THAT THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGIES IN ADMINISTRATIVE JUDICIAL PROCEDURE IS AN ACCEPTABLE USE ONLY OF SPECIALIZED INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS THAT CAN WORK UNDER HUMAN CONTROL. IT IS STATED THAT WHEN CONSIDERING ADMINISTRATIVE CASES IN AN ADMINISTRATIVE COURT OF MINOR COMPLEXITY, IT IS POSSIBLE TO USE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH WILL BE ABLE TO INDEPENDENTLY GENERALIZE AND ANALYZE LEGISLATION, JUDICIAL PRACTICE AND BE A RECOMMENDATION FOR A JUDGE WHEN MAKING A FAIR AND LAWFUL DECISION ON THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGIES IN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RIGHT TO JUDICIAL PROTECTION, BUT CAN BE USED TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT ARE CONTRARY TO THE RULE OF LAW, IN PARTICULAR REGARDING THE VIOLATION OF THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL IN ADMINISTRATIVE CASES IN ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS. THE LATTER REQUIRES THE IMPROVEMENT OF LEGAL REGULATION OF THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGIES IN ADMINISTRATIVE JUDICIAL PROCEDURE USING INTERNATIONAL PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS.
919	THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE IMPACT OF DIGITALIZATION ON RUSSIA'S NATIONAL LEGAL ORDER. AMONG THE MAIN DIRECTIONS OF SUCH INFLUENCE ARE THE EXPANSION OF THE BOUNDARIES OF LEGAL REGULATION AT THE EXPENSE OF VIRTUAL SPACE, THE DEMAND FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY THAN IN EXISTING LEGAL FORMS AND REGULATORY MECHANISMS, AND THE INCREASING ROLE OF THE INFORMATION FUNCTION OF LAW. THE ARTICLE EMPHASIZES THE CONSTRUCTED NATURE OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH REFERS TO THE CONSTANT ACTIVITY OF SUBJECTS OF LAW ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LEGAL NORMS. THESE ACTIONS MUST BE CARRIED OUT CONTINUOUSLY, AND THEY ARE VOLATILE, WHICH IS WHY THE RULE OF LAW IS A CONSTANTLY CHANGING ENTITY, AS ITS PARAMETERS ARE CONSTANTLY CHANGING. IN THIS REGARD, IT IS IMPORTANT TO STUDY THE IMPACT OF DIGITALIZATION ON THE MENTALITY AND LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE SUBJECT OF LAW. DIGITAL REALITY CHANGES THE MENTALITY OF THE SUBJECT OF LAW, ITS SENSE OF JUSTICE, AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE NATURE OF ACTIVITIES FOR IMPLEMENTING LEGAL NORMS. MASS BEHAVIOR OF LEGAL SUBJECTS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LEGAL NORMS IN THE CONDITIONS OF DIGITAL REALITY IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE BEHAVIOR OF SUBJECTS OF LAW IN OTHER CONDITIONS. DUE TO THE IMPACT OF DIGITALIZATION, THE LEGAL ORDER IS PARTIALLY TRANSFERRED TO VIRTUAL SPACE, WHICH COMPLICATES THE STATE'S CONTROL OVER LEGAL COMMUNICATIONS. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, CONVENTIONAL LEGAL REGULATORS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO MAINTAIN IT. UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DIGITALIZATION IN RUSSIA'S NATIONAL LEGAL ORDER, THE TYPICAL DOMINATION OF PUBLIC LAW OVER PRIVATE LAW WILL BE LOST, AND THE RATIO AND ROLE OF PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE LAW WILL CHANGE. THE CONCLUSION ADDRESSES ON POSSIBLE OCCURRENCES OF SUCH A PHENOMENON AS INDIVIDUAL LAW AND ORDER.
920	IN THIS ARTICLE, THE AUTHOR ANALYZES THE RELEVANT CASE LAW IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA AND IN STRASBOURG WITH REGARD TO THE RIGHT TO LIBERTY AND SECURITY OF THE PERSON (ART-5 OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS (ECHR)), PRESENTING THE SPECIFIC HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES AND SITUATIONS IN THAT COUNTRY AFTER THE DAYTON PEACE AGREEMENT. AFTER A SHORT HISTORICAL AND COMPARATIVE OVERVIEW OF THE RIGHT TO LIBERTY AND SECURITY OF THE PERSON, THE AUTHOR INTRODUCES THE COMPLEX SUBSTANTIVE, PROCEDURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROTECTION OF THAT LIBERTY. THE AUTHOR CONTINUES BY SYSTEMATICALLY PRESENTING THE MAIN HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES WITHIN ARTICLE 5 OF THE ECHR, DISCUSSING, ON THE ONE HAND, THE GRAVE VIOLATIONS OF THAT LIBERTY IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA DURING OR AFTER THE WAR (SUCH AS KIDNAPPING OR DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY BASED ON DISCRIMINATION ON NATIONAL OR RELIGIOUS GROUNDS) AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE DETERMINED EFFORTS OF THE COUNTRY'S HIGHEST LEGAL INSTITUTION TO PROTECT THE INDIVIDUALS CONCERNED AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE OF THE 'RULE OF LAW'. THE AUTHOR ALSO PRESENTS THE MAIN PROCEDURAL PROBLEMS THAT ARISE IN THE COURSE OF THE PROTECTION OF ARTICLE 5 OF THE ECHR, FOCUSING ON THE ECHR'S STANDARDS AND ITS INTRODUCTION INTO THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA. FINALLY, THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT ALL STATE AUTHORITIES (NOT ONLY THE HIGHEST JUDICIARY) HAVE TO FOLLOW THE RELEVANT JURISPRUDENCE AND STANDARDS OF THE ECHR IN ORDER TO BUILD A STATE THAT OPERATES UNDER THE RULE OF LAW AND, ALSO, TO FULFILL ITS INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS IN RESPECT OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE AND THE EUROPEAN UNION.
921	THE CONCEPT OF A SYSTEMIC FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS VIOLATION REFERS TO A PARTICULAR SET OF VIOLATIONS THAT ARE BOTH WIDESPREAD AND EMBEDDED, SO THEIR REOCCURRENCE MAY BE ASSUMED TO BE LIKELY. IT TAKES ON AT LEAST TWO DISTINCTIVE ROLES IN EU ASYLUM LAW AND POLICY. ONE ROLE IS LINKED WITH THE FUNCTIONING OF THE PRINCIPLE OF MUTUAL TRUST, A PRINCIPLE THAT OBLIGES MEMBER STATES TO RECOGNISE EACH OTHERS' SYSTEMS AND DECISIONS, PRESUMING THEM TO BE LEGAL, APART FROM EXCEPTIONAL CASES. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE PRINCIPLE SETS THE STANDARD FROM WHEN THE PRESUMPTION OF LEGALITY IS REBUTTED. IN ITS CONCEPTUALISATION AND APPLICATION, IT IS IN TENSION WITH EUROPEAN HUMAN RIGHTS LAW, AND, FOR A PERIOD, SET UP FRICTIONS BETWEEN THE CJEU (IN NS/ME AND OPINION 2/13) AND THE ECTHR (IN MSS AND TARAKHEL). THIS TALE OF JUDICIAL FRICTIONS IS NOT MERELY OF HISTORICAL INTEREST. ITS LEGACY IS, WE CONCLUDE, A THIN CONCEPT OF SYSTEMIC BREACH, CHARACTERISED BY AN OVER-INDIVIDUALIZED APPROACH TO ASSESSING THE HUMAN RIGHTS RISKS. THE SECOND ROLE FOR THE CONCEPT OF SYSTEMIC VIOLATIONS RELATES TO EMBEDDED VIOLATIONS, INCLUDING AT THE EU'S EXTERNAL BORDERS. WE DEMONSTRATE THE UTILITY OF THIS OTHER INVOCATION, IN PARTICULAR AS SYSTEMIC BREACHES OFTEN SIGNAL DEEPER RULE OF LAW ISSUES BOTH WITHIN PARTICULAR NATIONAL SYSTEMS AND EMBEDDED WITHIN THE COMMON EUROPEAN ASYLUM SYSTEM (CEAS). WE ILLUSTRATE THAT THE CEAS ITSELF BRINGS ABOUT SYSTEMIC HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. IDENTIFYING AND RESPONDING TO THE "SYSTEMIC" IN ASYLUM INCREASINGLY RELATES TO THE CREDIBILITY OF THE EU AS A UNION BASED ON THE RESPECT FOR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW.
922	IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT HANS KELSEN AND JURGEN HABERMAS INVOKE REALIST ARGUMENTS DRAWN FROM SOCIAL SCIENCE IN DEFENDING AN INTERNATIONAL, DEMOCRATIC HUMAN RIGHTS REGIME AGAINST CARL SCHMITT'S ATTACK ON THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, DESPITE EMBRACING THE REALIST SPIRIT OF KELSEN'S LEGAL POSITIVISM, HABERMAS CRITICIZES KELSEN FOR NEGLECTING TO CONNECT THE RULE OF LAW WITH A CONCEPT OF PROCEDURAL JUSTICE (PART I). I ARGUE, TO THE CONTRARY (PART II), THAT KELSEN DOES CONNECT THESE TERMS, ALBEIT IN A MANNER THAT MAY BE BEST DESCRIBED AS FUNCTIONAL, RATHER THAN CONCEPTUAL. INDEED, WHEREAS HABERMAS TENDS TO EMPHASIZE A CONCEPTUAL CONNECTION BETWEEN LAW AND MORALITY, AND HAS EVEN BEEN TEMPTED BY NATURAL LAW ARGUMENTS IN DEVELOPING HIS THEORY OF JURISPRUDENCE (SEE PART IV), KELSEN IS MORE RECEPTIVE TO ARGUMENTS DRAWN FROM LEGAL AND POLITICAL REALISM. YET HABERMAS IS HARDLY OBLIVIOUS TO THESE ARGUMENTS, AS CAN BE SEEN FROM HIS RECENT ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT HUMAN RIGHTS THAT SECURE SUBSISTENCE AND DEVELOPMENT DEPEND ON GLOBAL DOMESTIC POLICY' FOR THEIR FULL ENJOYMENT. THIS ACKNOWLEDGMENT, I SUBMIT, BRINGS HABERMAS' LEGAL PHILOSOPHY CLOSER TO KELSEN'S MONISTIC VIEW THAT A SUPRANATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS REGIME MUST REGULATE POLITICAL AS WELL AS PURELY LEGAL MATTERS (PART III). GIVEN THIS STRONGER ANALOGY BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND GLOBAL INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNANCE, I ARGUE (PART IV) THAT A GLOBAL HUMAN RIGHTS REGIME MUST ALSO INCORPORATE FEATURES OF CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW. CONCEDING THIS POINT, HOWEVER, RAISES FURTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INSULATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW FROM SO-CALLED EXTRA-LEGAL (POLITICAL) INFLUENCES. I CONCLUDE THAT NOT ONLY DO MULTICULTURAL DIFFERENCES IN UNDERSTANDING HUMAN RIGHTS (CONFLICTS BETWEEN LEGAL PARADIGMS) GENERATE POLITICAL PROBLEMS FOR INTERNATIONAL COURTS BUT SO DO COMPETING SUBSYSTEMS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.
923	TEN YEARS AFTER THE ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, IT ALMOST GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THE ACTS OF GROTESQUE VIOLENCE COMMITTED ON THAT DAY HAVE HAD ENORMOUS EFFECTS ON NATIONAL SECURITY LAW AND POLICY WORLDWIDE. TO BE LABELED A TERRORIST, OR TO BE ACCUSED OF INVOLVEMENT IN AN ACT OF TERRORISM, CARRIES FAR MORE SEVERE REPERCUSSIONS NOW THAN IT DID TEN YEARS AGO. THIS IS TRUE UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW AND UNDER DOMESTIC LAW IN NATIONS THAT HAVE DEALT WITH SERIOUS NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS FOR MANY YEARS. GIVEN THE U.N.'S GLOBAL MANDATE TO COMBAT TERRORISM AND THAT BEING DEFINED AS A TERRORIST CAN HAVE WIDESPREAD LEGAL IMPLICATIONS, THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO ADDRESS HOW LEGAL DEFINITIONS ARE SHAPED AND ANALYZES THE LACK OF A GLOBALLY ACCEPTED DEFINITION OF TERRORISM IN THE CONTEXT OF DOMESTIC COUNTERTERRORISM OBLIGATIONS. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES A SIGNIFICANT HISTORICAL GAP IN EXAMINING THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS AND DOMESTIC DEFINITIONS, THE PREVIOUSLY OVERLOOKED HISTORY AND EVOLUTION OF THOSE DEFINITIONS, AND THE POTENTIAL RULE OF LAW ISSUES ARISING FROM THE DEFINITIONS IN THEIR CURRENT FORM. IN EXAMINING COUNTERTERRORISM LAW IN THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND INDIA, IT IS CLEAR THAT DEFINITIONS OF TERRORISM UNDER VARIOUS DOMESTIC LAWS HAVE BEEN REPURPOSED FROM ONE LEGISLATIVE CONTEXT TO ANOTHER AND BROADENED IN APPLICATION, PARTICULARLY SINCE SEPTEMBER 11. THIS HAS LED TO THE ARGUABLY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF DISPARATE IMPACT ON OUTSIDER GROUPS AND THE UNMOORING FROM RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES. SINCE NEITHER INTERNATIONAL NORMS NOR DOMESTIC COURTS PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT CHECK AGAINST CREEPING DEFINITIONS, LEGISLATURES MUST TAKE PROACTIVE STEPS TO COMBAT POTENTIAL OVERREACHING IN APPLYING THE LABEL OF TERRORISM.
924	THIS CONTRIBUTION SUGGESTS A REPUBLICAN INTERPRETATION OF EU CITIZENSHIP RIGHTS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING THREE PROPOSITIONS: FIRST, THE MORE GLOBALISATION TRANSFORMS NATIONAL INTO TRANSNATIONAL PUBLIC GOODS, THE MORE DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN CONSTITUTIONALISM REQUIRES TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT TRANSNATIONAL PUBLIC GOODS TREATIES AS DEMOCRATIC LAW EMPOWERING CITIZENS TO INVOKE AND ENFORCE PRECISE AND UNCONDITIONAL MULTILEVEL MARKET REGULATIONS AND THE PROTECTION OF PUBLIC GOODS VIS-A-VIS MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS. SECONDLY, AS EU LAW, SUCH AS ARTS 2 AND 9-12 TEU, REQUIRES EU INSTITUTIONS AND MEMBER STATES TO PROTECT CONSTITUTIONAL, REPRESENTATIVE, PARTICIPATORY AND DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY AND LIMITS ALL INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EU POWERS BY FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND PROTECTION OF PUBLIC GOODS (RES PUBLICA), EU CITIZENS RIGHTLY CHALLENGE EU TRADE, INVESTMENT AND OTHER TREATIES THAT PRIVILEGE INTEREST GROUPS AND UNDERMINE THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTRACT OF CITIZENS AS CODIFIED IN THE EU CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. THIRDLY, JUST AS COMMON MARKET AND COMPETITION LAW INSIDE AND BEYOND THE EU PROTECT CITIZEN-DRIVEN NETWORK GOVERNANCE AND RIGHTS-BASED VIGILANCE OF EU CITIZENS EMBEDDED INTO COMPREHENSIVE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND A "SOCIAL MARKET ECONOMY" (ART. 3 TEU), EU INSTITUTIONS SHOULD RESPOND TO THE LEGITIMACY AND RULE-OF-LAW CRISES IN OTHER AREAS OF EU GOVERNANCE BY RECONNECTING EU LAW WITH EU CITIZENS AS DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPALS OF MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE AGENTS. ANTI-CITIZEN CLAUSES IN EU FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH NON-EUROPEAN COUNTRIES (SUCH AS ART. 30.6 CETA) AND DISCRIMINATORY ARBITRATION PRIVILEGES FOR FOREIGN INVESTORS ILLUSTRATE THE AUTHORITARIAN DISCONNECT OF EU BUREAUCRATS FROM EU CITIZENS; THEY RISK UNDERMINING RULE OF LAW, CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY, AND THE "SOCIAL MARKET ECONOMY" INSIDE THE EU.
925	AT PRESENT, THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT AND BACKGROUND REQUIRE US TO HAVE HIGHER REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DATA MODE OF COPYRIGHT TRANSACTION. ACCORDING TO THE PREVIOUS WAY TO CONDUCT COPYRIGHT TRANSACTIONS, IT WILL CAUSE A LOT OF UNNECESSARY TROUBLE, AND ACCORDING TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COPYRIGHT TRANSACTION DATABASE, WE ANALYSE THE DATA TYPES AND PATTERNS OF COPYRIGHT TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED COPYRIGHT TRANSACTION PROTECTION MEASURES AND RISK PREVENTION. ACCORDING TO THE COPYRIGHT TRANSACTION DATABASE, WE ADOPT BS NETWORK MODEL, CIF COPYRIGHT TRANSACTION DATA SET MODEL, CI DATA SET MODEL, DATA INTERACTIVE QUERY TECHNOLOGY, AND BLOCK MATCHING TECHNOLOGY TO DEAL WITH THE COPYRIGHT TRANSACTION DATA MODEL AND COPYRIGHT TRANSACTION RISK PREVENTION UNDER THE BACKGROUND OF INFORMA IONIZATION AS FOLLOWS: (1) WE USE BS NETWORK MODEL, CIF COPYRIGHT TRANSACTION DATA SET MODEL, AND CI DATA SET MODEL TO ANALYSE AND DETECT THE COPYRIGHT TRANSACTION DATA BEFORE TRANSACTION, WHICH BETTER REFLECTS THE NETWORK MODEL EFFECT OF SELF-ENHANCING OPERATION RATE OF COPYRIGHT TRANSACTION DATA AND EFFECTIVELY AVOIDS OVERFITTING PROBLEM. (2) BY USING INTERACTIVE DATA QUERY TECHNOLOGY, THE DATA PRESENTED IN THE PREPARATION WORK BEFORE THE TRANSACTION IS MORE DETAILED, THE SAMPLES ARE NORMALIZED, AND THE COLLECTED TRANSACTION DATA ARE TESTED FOR ACCURACY, WHICH CAN ELIMINATE POTENTIAL DANGERS. (3) THE METHOD OF SIMILARITY FEATURE RECONSTRUCTION OF COPYRIGHT TRANSACTION DATA SET COMPLETES THE EXTRACTION OF ASSOCIATION MATCHING FEATURES OF COPYRIGHT TRANSACTION DATA SYSTEM, WHICH PROVIDES STRONG SUPPORT FOR US TO PREVENT RISKS AND EFFECTIVELY MATCH DATA IN COPYRIGHT TRANSACTION.
926	THERE IS AN APPREHENSION IN THE DEMOCRATIC WORLD ABOUT THE POSSIBLE IMPACT OF THE ECONOMIC RISE OF CHINA ON THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS AGENDA. ALTHOUGH COMMUNIST CHINA HAS EMBRACED CAPITALISM BY LIBERALISING ITS ECONOMY, BY JOINING THE WTO AND BY RECOGNISING PRIVATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND THE RIGHT TO PRIVATE PROPERTY, IT HAS NOT BEEN AN ENTHUSIASTIC PARTNER WHEN IT COMES TO PROMOTING AND PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS. CHINA HAS SUPPORTED THE IDEA OF SO-CALLED "ASIAN VALUES", OR CULTURAL AND POLITICAL RELATIVISM, AS WELL AS PROMOTING THE IDEA OF A "CHINA MODEL OF DEMOCRACY", WHICH SEEKS TO SUPPORT ECONOMIC GROWTH AT THE EXPENSE OF CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES CHINA'S APPROACH TO HUMAN RIGHTS BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE OF THE UN AND WHETHER CHINA'S RISE AS A MAJOR ECONOMIC POWER POSES A THREAT OR OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS SYSTEM LED BY THE UN. IN DOING SO, IT CONSIDERS HOW CHINA IS CHANGING IN TERMS OF ITS APPROACH TO THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND WHY IT NEEDS TO BECOME A WILLING AND ENTHUSIASTIC PLAYER WITHIN THE UN SYSTEM TO PROMOTE AND PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT CHINA WILL NOT POSE A THREAT TO THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS AGENDA. ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, THE ONLY WAY FORWARD FOR CHINA IS TO EMBRACE THE RULE OF LAW, AND THIS WILL IN TURN ENTAIL RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. THUS, THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE UN TO INTRODUCE HUMAN RIGHTS LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE DEVELOPED BY THE UN TREATY BODIES TO THE CHINESE LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM.
927	AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY IS THE GUARANTOR OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH WE STRIVE TO BUILD IN UKRAINE. THIS INDEPENDENCE IS ENSURED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BY A STABLE AND SUFFICIENT FUNDING OF THE NATIONAL COURTS, WHICH HAS BECOME A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. THE RESOLUTION OF SUCH ISSUES HAS BEEN SOUGHT IN RECENT DECADES, BUT THE PROBLEM OF COURT FINANCING HAS BECOME ESPECIALLY ACUTE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, WHICH OCCURRED IN 2020. THIS HAS LED TO SOMEWHAT HOPELESS FEELINGS ABOUT THE CHOSEN WAY OF FORMING THE POLICY OF UKRAINIAN COURTS FINANCING AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION. OUR STUDY ATTEMPTS TO ANALYZE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE EXISTING MECHANISM OF FINANCING THE JUDICIARY IN UKRAINE, IN PARTICULAR, THROUGH THE PRISM OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR JUDGES AND ASSISTANT JUDGES DURING THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. THE FUNCTIONS WHICH THEY PERFORM CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE MAIN ONES DURING THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. THE AUTHORS PROPOSE THE ANALYSIS OF THE CASE ON THE PROTECTION OF THE RIGHT OF ASSISTANT JUDGES TO A DECENT SALARY, WHICH LASTED FOR YEARS IN ALL COURTS OF THE STATE. IN CONNECTION WITH THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC IN UKRAINE, A LAW WAS PASSED REDUCING THE SALARIES OF JUDGES, WHICH IS ALSO ANALYZED IN THE ARTICLE. THE SEARCH FOR A NEW, MORE MODERN APPROACH TO RESOLVING THE ISSUE OF A STABLE FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY WILL HELP TO SOLVE URGENT PROBLEMS AND ENSURE A REAL RULE OF LAW IN UKRAINE. IN PARTICULAR, OUR PROPOSED APPROACH TO THE FORMATION OF FINANCIAL AUTONOMY OF THE JUDICIARY IN UKRAINE IS SUGGESTED IN THIS STUDY.
928	DESPITE LONG-STANDING ALLEGATIONS OF UK INVOLVEMENT IN PRISONER ABUSE DURING COUNTERTERRORISM OPERATIONS AS PART OF THE US-LED WAR ON TERROR', A CONSISTENT NARRATIVE EMANATING FROM BRITISH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IS THAT BRITAIN NEITHER USES, CONDONES NOR FACILITATES TORTURE OR OTHER CRUEL, INHUMAN OR DEGRADING TREATMENT AND PUNISHMENT. WE ARGUE THAT SUCH DENIALS ARE UNTENABLE. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT THAT BRITAIN HAS BEEN DEEPLY INVOLVED IN POST-9/11 PRISONER ABUSE, AND WE CAN NOW PROVIDE THE MOST DETAILED ACCOUNT TO DATE OF THE DEPTH OF THIS INVOLVEMENT. WE ARGUE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY A PECULIARLY BRITISH APPROACH TO TORTURE IN THE WAR ON TERROR', WHICH IS PARTICULARLY WELL-SUITED TO SUSTAINING A NARRATIVE OF DENIAL. TO EXPLAIN THE NATURE OF UK INVOLVEMENT, WE ARGUE THAT IT CAN BE BEST UNDERSTOOD WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF HOW LAW AND SOVEREIGN POWER HAVE COME TO OPERATE DURING THE WAR ON TERROR'. WE TURN HERE TO THE WORK OF JUDITH BUTLER, AND EXPLORE THE ROLE OF BRITAIN AS A PETTY SOVEREIGN', OPERATING UNDER THE STATE OF EXCEPTION ESTABLISHED BY THE US EXECUTIVE. UK AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT THEMSELVES SUSPENDED THE RULE OF LAW SO OVERTLY; INDEED, THEY HAVE REPEATEDLY INSISTED ON THEIR COMMITMENT TO IT. NEVERTHELESS, THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONSTRUCT A RHETORICAL, LEGAL AND POLICY SCAFFOLD' THAT HAS ENABLED THEM TO DEMONSTRATE AT LEAST PROCEDURAL ADHERENCE TO HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS WHILE, AT THE SAME TIME, ALLOWING UK OFFICIALS TO ACQUIESCE IN THE ARBITRARY EXERCISE OF SOVEREIGNTY OVER INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DENIED ANY ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE REPRESENTATION OR REDRESS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW.
929	THIS ARTICLE WILL ADDRESS THE RIGHTS OF MINORITIES IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL IN 1988 AND THE SITUATION OF ETHNIC MINORITY INDIANS WHILE THE BRAZILIAN STATE, USING A METHODOLOGY DIE QUALITATIVE, EXPLORATORY AND LITERATURE. IN THE CONTEXT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RIGHTS OF MINORITIES ARE PRESENT IN THE DISCUSSIONS, MAINLY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, WHICH ENSURES THE IDEALS OF JUSTICE, EQUALITY AND DIGNITY AS SUPREME VALUES. IT IS KNOWN THAT THERE ARE MINORITIES IN MODERN SOCIETIES, BUT STILL END UP BEING SOCIALLY MARGINALIZED AND VIOLATED IN THEIR RIGHTS OF CITIZENSHIP AND DEMOCRACY. IN THIS AIM, THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES TO BE DISCUSSED ARE: THE RIGHT OF MINORITIES TO GUARANTEE THE DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN PERSON, THE ROLE OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW IN PRESERVING THE RIGHTS OF MINORITIES, AND, FINALLY, THE SITUATION OF THE INDIANS AS A MINORITY ETHNIC STATE BRAZILIAN FEDERAL CONSTITUTION OF 1988. INDEED, THE INDIANS, ONE OF THE SOCIAL GROUPS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE PROCESS OF MISCEGENATION IN BRAZIL, SUFFERED AND SOMEHOW, STILL SUFFER RACIAL DISCRIMINATION. IT CAN BE SEEN THEREFORE THAT THE BRAZILIAN SOCIETY, DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT ADVANCE REPRESENTED BY THE ENACTMENT OF THE 1988 FEDERAL CONSTITUTION, NOT ASSIMILATED THE DIMENSION OF THE RELEVANCE OF THE RECOGNITION OF ETHNO-CULTURAL DIVERSITY, ESPECIALLY THE NEED TO RECONCILE RESPECT FOR THE CULTURAL DIVERSITY OF EACH ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PEOPLE AND CULTURES WITHOUT THE ANNIHILATION THROUGH MUTUAL COOPERATION. FINALLY, ONE MUST RESPECT THE HUMANITY AS A WHOLE, FOR THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL JUSTICE, ELEVATE THE STATUS OF INDIGENOUS AND ETHNIC MINORITY WHILE RESPECTING THEIR FREEDOM AND EQUALITY BEFORE THE DOMINANT SOCIETY.
930	PURPOSE - THIS PAPER AIMS TO EXAMINE THE ROLE OF COUNTRY-LEVEL INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES IN STRENGTHENING THE LEVEL OF INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN AFRICA WHILE CONTROLLING FOR REAL GDP GROWTH, INTEREST RATE SPREAD, INFLATION AND COUNTRY CREDIT RATING. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE PAPER USES PANEL DATA FOR THE PERIOD 2009-2013. IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE RULE OF LAW, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND PROPERTY RIGHTS AS POTENTIAL INSTITUTIONAL DRIVERS OF THE LEVEL OF INVESTOR CONFIDENCE. THESE FACTORS ARE BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE RELEVANCE FROM THE EXTANT LITERATURE. CORRELATED PANELS-CORRECTED STANDARD ERRORS MODEL WAS USED TO ESTABLISH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES AND THE STRENGTH OF INVESTOR CONFIDENCE. FINDINGS - THE OVERALL RESULTS SHOW THAT RULE OF LAW, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, PROPERTY RIGHTS AND POLITICAL STABILITY EXHIBIT SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STRENGTH OF INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN AFRICAN ECONOMIES. THIS IMPLIES THAT ASKING AFRICAN ECONOMIES TO STRENGTHEN THESE INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES WILL RESULT IN ENHANCED INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN THEIR ECONOMIES. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THESE INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO ENHANCE INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN AFRICAN ECONOMIES. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - IN ADDITION TO THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF PROMOTING ECONOMIC REFORMS, A CORRESPONDING LONG-TERM GOAL OF STRENGTHENING INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES IN AFRICAN ECONOMIES SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR THEIR ECONOMIC REFORMS TO TAKE EFFECT, GOVERNMENTS IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES CAN, TO SOME DEGREE, ATTRACT INVESTORS INTO THEIR ECONOMIES BY ESTABLISHING CREDIBLE INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE KNOWLEDGE ON HOW COUNTRY-LEVEL INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES INFLUENCE THE LEVEL OF INVESTOR CONFIDENCE IN THE CONTEXT OF AFRICA.
931	THE MODERN RATIONALIST IDEA OF RULE OF LAW, AND MODERN RATIONALISM IN GENERAL, OWES MUCH TO PLATO AND TO PLATONISM. HOWEVER, PLATO'S STANCE TOWARDS THE LAWS OF THE CITY IS ALL BUT CLEAR. ON THE ONE HAND, WE HAVE THE SEEMINGLY 'TOTALITARIAN' PLATO OF THE REPUBLIC, A DIALOGUE WHICH DEFENDS THE ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY OF PHILOSOPHICAL WISDOM OVER ALL PRESCRIPTIONS THAT ARE ENSUING FROM EXISTING CITIES AND THEIR LAWS. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE HAVE THE 'MORE LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC' PLATO OF THE LAWS, A DIALOGUE WHICH PROMOTES A COMBINATION OF PHILOSOPHICAL WISDOM WITH RULE OF LAW. THIS AMBIVALENCE AS TO THE ISSUE OF LAWS PERMEATES ONE OF THE MOST ENIGMATIC OF PLATO'S WORKS, THE POLITICUS, A DIALOGUE THAT WAS WRITTEN AFTER THE REPUBLIC AND BEFORE THE LAWS. THE PRESENT ESSAY REJECTS BOTH THE 'TOTALITARIAN' AND THE 'LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC' UNDERSTANDING OF PLATO'S STANCE TOWARDS THE LAWS OF THE CITY. THE AUTHOR DEFENDS THE THESIS THAT LAWS IN THE POLITICUS DO NOT CONSTITUTE A STATIC FORM THAT WORKS AGAINST OR WITH PHILOSOPHICAL WISDOM AND/OR DEMOCRATIC SELF-LEGISLATION, BUT A FACTOR THAT GENERATES A SERIES OF INESCAPABLE PHILOSOPHICAL AND POLITICAL AMBIVALENCES. THIS APPROACH CORRESPONDS WITH MANY OF THE FINDINGS OF THE SO-CALLED 'POST-MODERN JURISPRUDENCE'. THAT IS, IT BRINGS TO THE FORE THE IMMANENT APORIAS OF PHILOSOPHICAL DIALECTICS, IT EMPHASISES THE IRREDUCIBLE UN-DECIDABILITY BETWEEN VIOLENCE AND CONSENT AS FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS OF THE LAW, AND IT STRESSES THE ADIAKRISIA (OUR INABILITY TO DISCRIMINATE) BETWEEN THE POISONOUS AND THE HEALING EFFECTS OF LAWS AS REGARDS THE ATTAINMENT OF CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL JUSTICE.
932	JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE THROUGH REASONED INTERPRETATION, APPLICATION AND CLARIFICATION OF LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND RULES IS AMONG THE OLDEST PARADIGMS OF 'CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE'. THE PRINCIPLES OF PROCEDURAL JUSTICE UNDERLYING WTO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES, LIKE THE CONFORMITY OF WTO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT RULINGS WITH PRINCIPLES OF 'SUBSTANTIVE JUSTICE', REMAIN CONTROVERSIAL. THIS CONTRIBUTION CRITICIZES THE RECENT, HARSH CONDEMNATION OF THE WTO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT RULINGS IN THE BRAZIL TYRES CASE AS 'COMMITTING GRAVE INJUSTICE'. AFTER RECALLING THE CUSTOMARY LAW REQUIREMENT OF INTERPRETING TREATIES AND SETTLING INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES 'IN CONFORMITY WITH PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE' AND HUMAN RIGHTS, THE CONTRIBUTION EXAMINES THE WTO APPELLATE BODY CASE-LAW FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF DIVERSE CONCEPTIONS OF 'CONSERVATIVE' AND 'REFORMATIVE JUSTICE', 'GENERAL' AND 'PARTICULAR JUSTICE', PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE JUSTICE, NATIONAL AND MULTILEVEL 'CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE', AND JUDICIAL PROTECTION OF TRANSNATIONAL RULE-OF-LAW FOR THE BENEFIT OF CITIZENS. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THE PANEL, APPELLATE AND ARBITRATION REPORTS IN THE BRAZIL TYRES DISPUTE, LIKE MANY OTHER WTO APPELLATE BODY REPORTS, REFLECT A GROWING CONCERN 'TO ADMINISTER JUSTICE' IN WTO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT PROCEEDINGS. WTO JUDGES AND INVESTOR-STATE ARBITRATORS SHOULD FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF THE ICJ AND OF EUROPEAN COURTS AND CLARIFY THE 'PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE' JUSTIFYING THEIR SETTLEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DISPUTES SO THAT 'JUSTICE IS NOT ONLY DONE, BUT ALSO SEEN TO BE DONE', ALBEIT SUBJECT TO 'TRIAL AND ERROR'. LEGAL PRACTITIONERS SHOULD SUPPORT-AND, AS PART OF THE 'INVISIBLE COLLEGE OF INTERNATIONAL LAWYERS', HOLD ACCOUNTABLE-THE EMERGENCE OF AN 'INTERNATIONAL JUDICIARY' AS AN 'EPISTEMIC COMMUNITY' COMMITTED TO DEFENDING RULE OF LAW, PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES AND 'PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE' IN MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION AMONG CITIZENS ACROSS NATIONAL FRONTIERS.
933	RESEARCH SUMMARYUSING A SAMPLE OF 205,792 INDIVIDUALS IN 70 COUNTRIES WITH 39 LANGUAGES, THIS PAPER PRESENTS NOVEL EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR HOW A LANGUAGE'S FUTURE TIME REFERENCE, DEFINED AS THE REQUIREMENT THAT SPEAKERS MARK TIME IN THE FUTURE, AFFECTS A SPEAKER'S LIKELIHOOD OF ENGAGING IN SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP. FTR SUBTLY SHAPES A SPEAKER'S TEMPORAL ORIENTATION, SUCH THAT SPEAKING A FUTURED LANGUAGE (I.E., STRONG FTR) FAVORS A SHORT-TERM ORIENTATION WHICH POSITIVELY AFFECTS THE LIKELIHOOD OF BEING A SOCIAL ENTREPRENEUR. FURTHERMORE, INSTITUTIONAL UNCERTAINTY ARISING FROM WEAKLY ENTRENCHED INSTITUTIONS MODERATES THIS RELATIONSHIP. INDIVIDUALS WHO SPEAK FUTURED LANGUAGES IN CONTEXTS CHARACTERIZED BY REGULATORY INSTITUTIONAL UNCERTAINTY (WEAK RULE OF LAW, WEAK PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND STRONG CORRUPTION) ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS ARE DISCUSSED.MANAGERIAL SUMMARYTHIS PAPER EXAMINES THE INFLUENCE OF LANGUAGE AND REGULATORY INSTITUTIONS ON AN INDIVIDUAL'S DECISION TO ENGAGE IN SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP. WE SHOW THAT ENTREPRENEURIAL STRATEGIES TOWARDS SOCIAL VALUE CREATION ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE PURSUED IN COUNTRIES WHERE LANGUAGE IS CHARACTERIZED AS FUTURED (I.E., USING SENTENCES WITH "WILL/SHALL + INFINITIVE ") WITH THE LINGUISTIC FEATURE OF FUTURE TIME REFERENCE (FTR). MOREOVER, THE POSITIVE IMPACT FTR HAS ON THE STRATEGIC DECISION TO BECOME A SOCIAL ENTREPRENEUR INTENSIFIES WHEN THERE IS REGULATORY INSTITUTIONAL UNCERTAINTY. THAT IS, THE PROBABILITY AN INDIVIDUAL IS A SOCIAL ENTREPRENEUR INCREASES WHEN THERE IS WEAK RULE OF LAW, WEAK PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND STRONG CORRUPTION WITHIN A COUNTRY. IN SUM, OUR STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANT INTERPLAY BETWEEN LANGUAGE, AN OVERLOOKED COGNITIVE INSTITUTION, AND REGULATORY INSTITUTIONS IN SHAPING ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIORS AND SOCIAL OUTCOMES.
934	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY IN NEPAL AFTER THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION AND EXAMINES ITS POSITION VIA THE LENSES BOTH OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS AND THE RULE OF LAW. BY COMPARING THE PRESENT CONSTITUTION WITH THE PREVIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL DOCUMENTS OF NEPAL, IT SEEMS THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL DRAFTERS ON THE ONE HAND AIMED TO ENHANCE THE INSTITUTIONAL INDEPENDENCE OF THE SUPREME COURT, THE HEAD OF THE JUDICIARY, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY LIMITED ITS JURISDICTION PERTAINING TO THE INTERNA CORPORIS AND TO THE CONSTITUTIONALITY REVIEW OF CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS. FURTHERMORE, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE JUDICIARY DOES NOT SIMPLY REPRESENT ONE POWER IN THE SEPARATION OF POWERS SYSTEM AND DOES NOT SIMPLY HOLD THE ROLE OF THE GATEKEEPER OF THE RULE OF LAW. MORE IMPORTANTLY, AS IT WAS SHOWN IN THE NEPALESE CASE, THE JUDICIARY, PRECISELY THE SUPREME COURT, CAN PLAY A VERY PROACTIVE AND CREATIVE ROLE IN THE CONSTITUTION-MAKING PROCESS. HENCE, THIS ARTICLE OFFERS JUSTIFICATIONS, BOTH FORMAL AND SUBSTANTIVE, FOR THE INTERVENTION OF THE SUPREME COURT IN THE CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE NEW LEGAL ORDER. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE EXISTENCE OF AN INTERIM CONSTITUTION MAY GRANT DIRECT OR INDIRECT AUTHORITY TO THE COURT TO INTERVENE IN THE CONSTITUTION MAKING PROCESS, FOR INSTANCE BY CONTROLLING THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, REVIEWING ITS ACTS AND EVEN CERTING THE FINAL CONSTITUTIONAL DOCUMENT. IN ADDITION, THE COURTS' PARTICIPATION IN THE CONSTITUTION-MAKING PROCESS MIGHT BE JUSTIFIED ON SUBSTANTIVE GROUNDS, SUCH AS NATURAL LAW PRINCIPLES, COMMON CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES, OR THE SO-CALLED SUPRA-CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES THAT EXIST IN EVERY DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY AND ARE PERVADED IN THE GENERAL BELIEF OF THE PEOPLE.
935	A CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS CLAUSE MANAGES THE CONFLICT BETWEEN CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND THE LEGISLATIVE PURSUIT OF BROADER SOCIAL OBJECTIVES. IN SIX PARADIGM POSTWAR CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACIES-CANADA, GERMANY, INDIA, ISRAEL, POLAND, AND SOUTH AFRICA-THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY HAS EMERGED AS THE ANALYTICAL FULCRUM OF THE JUDICIAL INQUIRY INTO THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF RIGHTS LIMITATIONS. CRITICISM OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY HAS CRYSTALLIZED INTO THREE MAIN OBJECTIONS: PROPORTIONALITY ANALYSIS DEVALUES RIGHTS BY EXPOSING THEM TO THE ORDINARY PROCESSES OF POLITICAL BARGAINING; IT OFFENDS THE RULE OF LAW BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON UNPREDICTABLE MORAL REASONING; AND IT INVOLVES THE UNINTELLIGIBLE BALANCING OF INCOMMENSURABLE GOODS. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS, FIRST, WHETHER LIMITATIONS JURISPRUDENCE IN THE PARADIGM COUNTRIES CONTAINS RESPONSES TO THESE OBJECTIONS. IT ARGUES THAT THERE ARE WAYS OF MEETING THE DEVALUATION AND INCOMMENSURABILITY OBJECTIONS, BUT SUGGESTS THAT MODELS OF ANALYSIS THAT PURPORT TO MEET THE UNPREDICTABILITY OBJECTION BY MINIMIZING THE ROLE OF MORAL REASONING ARE UNDERMINED BY THE CONTINUED JUDICIAL RELIANCE ON MORAL REASONING IN THE PARADIGM COUNTRIES. THE ARTICLE ARGUES, SECOND, THAT MORAL REASONING MAINTAINS THIS MAGNETIC ATTRACTION OVER JUDGES BECAUSE THE CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AT WORK IN THE PARADIGM COUNTRIES, AND WHICH JUDGES AND OTHER PUBLIC OFFICIALS ARE COMMITTED TO UPHOLDING, COMPELS JUDGES AND LEGISLATORS TO ENGAGE DIRECTLY AND FULLY WITH THE NORMATIVE COMMITMENTS A POLITICAL COMMUNITY MAKES AND WHICH INFORM ITS CONSTITUTION. BECAUSE PEOPLE REASONABLY DISAGREE OVER THE CONTENT AND CONTOURS OF THESE NORMATIVE COMMITMENTS, JUDGES CANNOT RELY ON A DE-MORALIZED ANALYSIS BUT MUST MAKE ARGUMENTS INTENDED TO PERSUADE RATIONAL, MORALLY AUTONOMOUS MEMBERS OF A POLITICAL COMMUNITY HOW OUR MOST FUNDAMENTAL NORMATIVE COMMITMENTS SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE LEGAL SYSTEM.
936	AS DIPLOMATS ACROSS THE WORLD GATHERED IN PARIS IN SPRING 1919 TO DISCUSS THE PEACE PROCESS, OBSERVERS ASKED WHITHER INDIA? CRITICS WONDERED HOW THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT COULD ENACT EMERGENCY LAWS SUCH AS THE ROWLATT ACTS AT THE SAME TIME AS IT INTRODUCED THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA ACT OF 1919, WHICH WAS INTENDED TO EXPAND INDIAN INVOLVEMENT IN GOVERNING THE BRITISH DOMINIONS ON THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT. BECAUSE BRITAIN PRESENTED ITSELF AS A LIBERAL FORM OF EMPIRE ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE, ITS WILLINGNESS TO SUSPEND RULE OF LAW OVER ITS SUBJECTS APPEARED CONTRADICTORY. INDIA'S SUPPORT OF THE ALLIED POWERS ALLOWED INDIAN MODERATES TO REPRESENT INDIA IN PARIS; DURING THE WAR, INDIAN SUBJECTS HAD CONTRIBUTED OVER ONE MILLION SOLDIERS AND SUFFERED INFLUENZA, PLAGUE, AND FAMINE. THE POSSIBILITY OF A NEW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THOSE GOVERNING AND THOSE BEING GOVERNED LED MANY INDIANS TO DEMAND AN ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW, A GUARANTEE OF CIVIL LIBERTIES, AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF A GOVERNMENT THAT WAS FOR AND BY THE INDIAN PEOPLE. IN A TIME OF REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA, AND ASSASSINATIONS BY ANARCHISTS IN ITALY AND FRANCE, IT SEEMED FOOLHARDY TO REPRESS RADICALS BY CENSORING THE PRESS, PREVENTING THE RIGHT OF INDIVIDUALS TO ASSEMBLE, OR DETAINING SUSPECTS BEFORE THEY HAD COMMITTED ANY CRIMES. LALA LAJPAT RAI, AN INDIAN POLITICAL ACTIVIST WHO HAD BEEN PART OF THE PROGRESSIVE WING OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS, WROTE FROM THE UNITED STATES, INDIA IS A PART OF THE WORLD AND REVOLUTION IS IN THE AIR ALL THE WORLD OVER. THE EFFORT TO KILL IT BY REPRESSION AND SUPPRESSION IS FUTILE, UNWISE, AND STUPID.
937	THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH HOW THE RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN CONTEMPORARY EGYPT. WHAT HAVE BEEN THE CHANGES FOR THE LAST 3 YEARS SINCE A. F. EL-SISI HAS BECOME PRESIDENT AND WHY HAVE THEY COME ABOUT? ALSO AUTHOR STUDIED EL-SISI'S ATTITUDE TO DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS TRYING TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING STUDY QUESTIONS: WHY DID EGYPT FAIL TO TAKE THE PATH TO DEMOCRACY? WHAT DRAWBACKS HAVE LEAD TO THE COUP D'ETAT IN 2013? WHAT IS EL-SISI'S OPINION AS TO THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY? THE CONSTITUTION 2014 IN COMPARISON WITH THE CONSTITUTION 2012 IS BELIEVED TO BE LESS LIBERAL. THE POLICY OF AUTHORITARIANISM STEMS FROM EL-SISI'S NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TO THE CONCEPT OF DEMOCRACY. HE BELIEVES THAT DEMOCRACY IS A SECULAR CONCEPT, NOT VERY WELL ACCEPTED BY THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION OF MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES, WHICH SHOULD BE ISLAM. THE ARTICLE IS DIVIDED INTO SEVERAL SECTIONS: THE FIRST SETS OUT THE REASONS FOR THE TOPPLE OF THE FIRST DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED PRESIDENT MOHAMMED MURSI AND THE EL-SISI'S SUCCESS FOR COMING TO POWER. IN THE SECOND SECTION I STUDY HIS VIEWS ON DEMOCRACY. THE THIRD SECTION PRESENTS THE FACTS ( MASS DEATH SENTENCES, RETURNING FUNCTIONARIES OF HOSNI MUBARAQ INTO POWER AND THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE CORRUPTION CASES), WHICH ARE SIGNS OF REPRESSION AND AUTHORITARIANISM. THE JUDICIARY HAS BEEN WEAKENED DUE TO THE PERSECUTION OF THE JUDGES FOR THEIR SUPPORT OF MOHAMMED MURSI. WITH A WEAK JUDICIARY AND GROWING DISCONTENT OF THE POPULATION WITH THE ECONOMIC AND SECURITY SITUATION, WE CAN ASSUME THAT THE FUTURE PATH OF AUTHORITARIANISM COULD LEAD TO DESTABILIZATION.
938	IN THE UNITED STATES, THE FAILURE TO ACHIEVE IMMIGRATION REFORM AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL HAS RESULTED IN NUMEROUS RESPONSES IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN MOST IMPACTED BY THE SETTLEMENT OF NEW IMMIGRANTS. SOME OF THESE RESPONSES HAVE EMERGED IN SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED A RAPID RISE IN THE FOREIGN-BORN POPULATION DURING THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. THIS ESSAY OFFERS AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF ONE SUCH COMMUNITY, FARMERS BRANCH, TEXAS, COVERED NATIONALLY FOR A SERIES OF ANTI-IMMIGRANT ORDINANCES PASSED BY ITS CITY COUNCIL. FOLLOWING A DESCRIPTION OF THE HISTORY OF THIS COMMUNITY, THE GROWTH OF ITS FOREIGN-BORN POPULATION, AND THE LEGAL MANOEUVRES TO CONTROL UNAUTHORIZED IMMIGRATION, THE ESSAY ARGUES THAT ANTI-IMMIGRANT LEGISLATION IN LOCAL PLACES LIKE FARMERS BRANCH IS AT ITS CORE A REFLECTION OF A DEBATE ABOUT AND ANXIETY OVER AMERICAN IDENTITY -- HOW IT IS DEFINED AND HOW IT IS CHANGING. IN PARTICULAR, THESE RESPONSES ARE ABOUT A PERCEIVED THREAT TO MIDDLE CLASS STATUS AND IDENTITY. THIS IS DISCUSSED FIRST IN RELATIONSHIP TO ISSUES OF HOME OWNERSHIP AND INCOME AND THEN, IN RELATION TO CULTURAL DIMENSIONS OF CLASS, INCLUDING MATTERS OF TASTE AND THE SPATIALIZATIONS OF MIDDLE CLASS IDENTITY. FINALLY, THE PAPER UNPACKS THE CONCEPT OF "RULE OF LAW". BY INVOKING THE CLAIM THAT AMERICANS ARE LAW ABIDING WHILE UNAUTHORIZED IMMIGRANTS HAVE BROKEN THE LAW, LAWFULNESS BECOMES AN EXCLUSIONARY TOOL AND GIVES THOSE WHO SUPPORT ANTI-IMMIGRANT ORDINANCES A PLATFORM FOR LEGISLATING A CERTAIN QUALITY OF LIFE, AND DE-AMERICANIZING THOSE WHO DO NOT FIT THEIR CONCEPTUALIZATION OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AMERICAN. RULE OF LAW BECOMES A WEAPON IN THE FIGHT FOR MIDDLE CLASS STATUS AND THE STATUS QUO.
939	BACKGROUND: EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CRIMINOLOGY REFERS TO HEALTH ISSUES AFFECTING INCARCERATED AND NONINCARCERATED OFFENDER POPULATIONS, A GROUP RECOGNIZED AS BEING CHALLENGING TO CONDUCT RESEARCH WITH. NOTWITHSTANDING THIS, AN URGENT NEED EXISTS FOR NEW KNOWLEDGE AND INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE HEALTH, JUSTICE, AND SOCIAL OUTCOMES FOR THIS MARGINALIZED POPULATION.OBJECTIVE: TO BETTER UNDERSTAND RESEARCH OUTPUTS IN THE FIELD OF EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CRIMINOLOGY, WE EXAMINED THE LEAD AUTHOR'S AFFILIATION BY ANALYZING PEER-REVIEWED PUBLISHED OUTPUTS TO DETERMINE COUNTRIES AND ORGANIZATIONS (EG, UNIVERSITIES, GOVERNMENTAL AND NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS) RESPONSIBLE FOR PEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS.METHODS: WE USED A SEMIAUTOMATED APPROACH TO EXAMINE THE FIRST-AUTHOR AFFILIATIONS OF 23,904 PUBMED EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES RELATED TO INCARCERATED AND OFFENDER POPULATIONS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH BETWEEN 1946 AND 2021. WE ALSO MAPPED RESEARCH OUTPUTS TO THE WORLD JUSTICE PROJECT RULE OF LAW INDEX TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHETHER THERE WAS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RESEARCH OUTPUTS AND THE OVERALL STANDARD OF A COUNTRY'S JUSTICE SYSTEM.RESULTS: NORDIC COUNTRIES (SWEDEN, NORWAY, FINLAND, AND DENMARK) HAD THE HIGHEST RESEARCH OUTPUTS PROPORTIONAL TO THEIR INCARCERATED POPULATION, FOLLOWED BY AUSTRALIA. UNIVERSITY-AFFILIATED FIRST AUTHORS COMPRISED 73.3% OF PUBLISHED ARTICLES, WITH THE KAROLINSKA INSTITUTE (SWEDEN) BEING THE MOST PUBLISHED, FOLLOWED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES (AUSTRALIA). GOVERNMENT-AFFILIATED FIRST AUTHORS WERE ON 8.9% OF PUBLISHED OUTPUTS, AND PRISON-AFFILIATED GROUPS WERE ON 1%. COUNTRIES WITH THE LOWEST RESEARCH OUTPUTS ALSO HAD THE LOWEST SCORES ON THE RULE OF LAW INDEX.CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY PROVIDES IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON WHO IS PUBLISHING RESEARCH IN THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CRIMINOLOGY FIELD. THIS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR PROMOTING RESEARCH DIVERSITY, INDEPENDENCE, FUNDING EQUITY, AND PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN UNIVERSITIES AND GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS THAT CONTROL ACCESS TO INCARCERATED AND OFFENDING POPULATIONS.
940	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE RECENTLY INTRODUCED MEASURES OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL AND CRIMINAL JURY SYSTEM IN THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA, AND THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RAMIFICATIONS. THE ARTICLE INITIALLY EXAMINES SUCH MECHANISMS AS CURRENTLY IN OPERATION AND THEIR INTENDED FUNCTION OF ACTIVATING INTEREST-REPRESENTATION AND PARTICIPATION TO SUPPLEMENT THE REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY THAT THE NATION'S CONSTITUTION ADOPTS AS PRINCIPLE. THE ARTICLE THEN DISCUSSES THE SUSTAINABILITY AND FURTHER CONSTITUTIONAL RAMIFICATIONS OF SUCH MEASURES IN SOUTH KOREA'S IDIOSYNCRATIC CONSTITUTIONAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXT, IN TERMS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM, DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE MAIN PART OF THE ARTICLE, THE ARTICLE PRIMARILY LOOKS INTO (1) THE VOTER-INITIATIVE SYSTEM UNDER THE LOCAL AUTONOMY ACT, BY WHICH THE RESIDENTS OF A LOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT MAY REQUEST THE ENACTMENT, REVISION OR ABROGATION OF LOCAL ORDINANCES THROUGH SUBSEQUENT INVOLVEMENT OF THE LOCAL PARLIAMENT; (2) THE LEGISLATIVE PETITION SYSTEM UNDER THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ACT, THE PETITION ACT AND THE LOCAL AUTONOMY ACT, AND THE RELEVANT NGO LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITIES; (3) THE RECALL SYSTEM UNDER THE RECALL ACT, UNDER WHICH THE RESIDENTS OF A LOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT MAY RECALL THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR AND THE MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL LEGISLATURE; AND (4) THE CRIMINAL JURY SYSTEM UNDER THE CIVIL PARTICIPATION IN CRIMINAL TRIALS ACT. THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE LAW AND PRACTICE PERTAINING THERETO, AND PRESENTS RELEVANT STATISTICS. IN THE LAST CHAPTER, THE ARTICLE ANALYZES FURTHER CONSTITUTIONAL RAMIFICATIONS OF SUCH DIRECT AND PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY MEASURES. THE CONCEPTS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM, DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN SOUTH KOREA'S IDIOSYNCRATIC SETTING WILL BE REVISITED AS THE CONTEXT FOR SUCH ANALYSIS.
941	THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO PRESENT A NEW FRAMEWORK TO DESIGN AND RUN A RESPONSIVE AND RESILIENT HEALTH SYSTEM. IT CAN BE USED BY BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC, PROFIT AND NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS IN ORDER TO TRANSLATE STRATEGIC GOALS OF AN ORGANIZATION INTO DESIRABLE AND INTENDED BEST PRACTICE, AND RESULTS. THIS INCLUDES THE HEALTH SECTOR. THE FRAMEWORK IS BASED ON THE FOUR PILLARS OF LEADERSHIP, ETHICS, GOVERNANCE AND SYSTEMS, HENCE CALLED LEGS FRAMEWORK. IT CAN COMPLEMENT THE SIX WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION BUILDING BLOCKS THAT GUIDE INPUTS TO HELP A HEALTH SYSTEM ACHIEVE THE INTENDED GOALS. DESPITE ALL THE STRENGTHS OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION BUILDING BLOCKS FOR HEALTH SYSTEMS STRENGTHENING, IT IS IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW CHALLENGES: ETHICS IS ASSUMED BUT IS NOT EXPLICITLY STATED AS PART OF ANY BUILDING BLOCK. FURTHERMORE, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION FRAMEWORK LACKS THE FLEXIBILITY TO ACCOMMODATE OTHER IMPORTANT FACTORS WHICH MAY DIFFER IN VARIOUS SETTINGS AND CONTEXTS. HENCE, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION BUILDING BLOCKS ARE EITHER DIFFICULT TO APPLY OR INSUFFICIENT IN CERTAIN CONTEXTS, ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES WITH RAMPANT CORRUPTION, WEAK RULE OF LAW AND SYSTEMS. THIS PAPER EXPLORES AREAS TO STRENGTHEN THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK SO AS TO ACHIEVE THE INTENDED RESULTS EFFICIENTLY IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS. THE AUTHORS PROPOSE LEGS (LEADERSHIP, ETHICS, GOVERNANCE AND SYSTEMS FRAMEWORK). THIS FRAMEWORK IS VERY FLEXIBLE, SIMPLE TO USE, EASY TO REMEMBER, ACCOMMODATES THE EXISTING SIX WHO BUILDING BLOCKS AND CAN BETTER GUIDE DIFFERENT HEALTH SYSTEMS AND ACTORS TO ACHIEVE INTENDED GOALS BY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE CONTEXTUAL FACTORS LIKE DEFICITS IN MORAL CAPITAL, RULE OF LAW OR SOCIOECONOMIC DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH.
942	PURPOSE - THE MAIN AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYZE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF BANGLADESH, WHICH COMPRISES ALL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS THAT PERFORMS THE DELICATE TASK OF ENSURING RULE OF LAW IN THE SOCIETY. THE PAPER DEPICTS THE HISTORY AND EVOLUTION OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN BANGLADESH FROM ANCIENT PERIOD TO PRESENT DAY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE STUDY IS QUALITATIVE IN NATURE AND BASED ON SECONDARY SOURCES OF MATERIALS LIKE BOOKS, JOURNAL ARTICLES, GOVERNMENT ORDERS, RULES, ACTS, NEWSPAPER REPORTS, ETC. RELEVANT LITERATURE HAS ALSO BEEN COLLECTED THROUGH INTERNET BROWSING. FINDINGS - THE MAJOR FINDINGS OF THIS PAPER ARE: THERE IS A WELL-ORGANIZED COURT SYSTEM IN BANGLADESH WHICH IS IN FACT THE REPLICA OF THE SYSTEM INTRODUCED BY BRITISH RULERS AND IT IS WIDELY ACCEPTED IN THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION OF BANGLADESH. THE ANCIENT JUDICIAL SYSTEM WAS NOT BASED ON RULE OF LAW RATHER ON CAPRICE AND CASTE CONSIDERATION. THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT ALWAYS ATTEMPTS TO CONTROL THE JUDICIARY THROUGH DIFFERENT MECHANISMS, WHICH INCLUDE THE APPOINTMENT, TENURE AND DISCIPLINE OF JUDGES FROM ANCIENT PERIOD. THEREFORE, THE INDEPENDENCE OF JUDICIARY IS VULNERABLE FROM ANCIENT TIME TO PRESENT DAY AND EVEN AFTER SEPARATION OF THE JUDICIARY FROM THE EXECUTIVE (NOVEMBER 2007) THE INTERFERENCE OF THE EXECUTIVE OVER THE JUDICIARY IS STILL CONTINUING. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THIS PAPER OPENS A NEW WINDOW FOR THE POLICY MAKERS AND CONCERNED AUTHORITIES TO TAKE NECESSARY STEPS FOR OVERCOMING THE EXISTING LIMITATIONS OF JUDICIARY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE PAPER WILL BE OF INTEREST TO LEGAL PRACTITIONERS, POLICY MAKERS, MEMBERS OF CIVIL SOCIETY, AND THOSE IN THE FIELD OF JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN BANGLADESH AND SOME OTHER BRITISH COLONIAL COMMON LAW COUNTRIES.
943	DESPITE THE DIFFERENCES OF APPROACH THAT DIFFERENT NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEMS MAY ADOPT REGARDING DISCRETIONARY POWERS, IN GENERAL TERMS THE MAIN ISSUE OF DISCUSSION STAYS THE SAME: GIVEN THAT DISCRETION IS ACCEPTED AND CONSIDERED AN ESSENTIAL LEGAL TECHNIQUE IN THE CONTEXT OF ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS, HOW, AND TO WHICH EXTENT, MAY DISCRETIONARY POWERS BE CONTROLLED AND SUBJECTED TO REVIEW BY COURTS? THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT ARTICLE IS TO DISCUSS DISCRETIONARY POWERS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF LEGISLATIVE DRAFTING, WITH THE AIM TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC TOOLS TO BE USED BY LAW-MAKERS IN ORDER TO PREVENT DISCRETION FROM TURNING INTO ARBITRARINESS. THEREFORE, STARTING FROM AN ANALYSIS OF PORTUGUESE LEGAL DOCTRINE ON THE CONCEPT OF DISCRETIONARY POWERS, THE PRESENT ARTICLE WILL ADDRESS THREE MAIN ISSUES. FIRST, CLARIFICATION AS TO HOW LEGAL DISCRETION IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD AND HOW TO IDENTIFY DISCRETIONARY POWERS GRANTED BY LEGISLATION. SECOND, IDENTIFICATION OF THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF LEGAL DISCRETION, IN ORDER TO DETERMINE NORMATIVE CRITERIA ACCORDING TO WHICH WE CAN SETTLE UNDER WHICH CONDITIONS DISCRETIONARY POWERS IN LEGISLATIVE DRAFTING IS TO BE EMPLOYED OR NOT. THIRD, IDENTIFICATION OF WHICH LEGISLATIVE DRAFTING TOOLS MAY BE USED BY LAW-MAKERS IN ORDER TO GRANT DISCRETIONARY POWERS. OVERALL, BY FOCUSING ON LAW-MAKING TECHNIQUES, THE ARTICLE AIMS TO DEMONSTRATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH LEGISLATIVE DRAFTING TOOLS, SUCH AS THE ONES IDENTIFIED IN THIS ARTICLE, ARE POWERFUL TOOLS TO BETTER IDENTIFY DISCRETIONARY POWERS IN THE LAW, BUT ALSO TO ENSURE THAT THESE POWERS ARE GRANTED ONLY WHEN ACTUALLY NECESSARY. TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THAT MIGRATION AND ASYLUM LAW USUALLY INVOLVES REFERENCE TO FUNDAMENTAL INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE PROVISION OF DISCRETIONARY POWERS OUGHT TO BE AVOIDED WHENEVER THERE ARE NO SOLID AND REASONED GROUNDS FOR THEIR USE, SO THAT DISCRETION REMAINS A TOOL FOR REGULATION AND DOES NOT BECOME ARBITRARINESS.
944	THIS PAPER ILLUMINATES THE INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT'S FAILURE TO SATISFACTORILY ADDRESS THE EVER-RISING VIOLENCE LINKED TO HERDER-FARMER CONFLICTS AND THE EMERGENCE OF VIGILANTE SECURITY MEASURES AT THE GEO-REGIONAL LEVEL. IT ALSO EXAMINES THE OVERALL IMPLICATIONS OF VIGILANTE SECURITY MEASURES VIS-A-VIS SECURITY CHALLENGES IN NIGERIA. THE PAPER FINDS THAT THE PREDISPOSITION TO, AND ADOPTION OF VIGILANTE SECURITY STRATEGIES IS INDICATIVE OF THE FAILURE OF FORMAL SECURITY APPARATUSES TO LIVE UP TO THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATES. THE PAPER RECOMMENDS PREVENTIVE AND INCLUSIVE POLICING AS WELL AS STRICT ADHERENCE TO THE TENETS OF JUSTICE IN LINE WITH THE RULE OF LAW.
945	THIS SHORT ARTICLE OFFERS TWO OBSERVATIONS ABOUT INTERNATIONAL ADJUDICATION OF LAND DISPUTES. FIRST, THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT SUCH ADJUDICATION IS INTENDED TO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT, BUT THAT THIS GOAL IS SERVED BETTER, IF COUNTER-INTUITIVELY, BY REJECTING THE SO-CALLED SALINI CONTRIBUTION-TO-DEVELOPMENT TEST IN FAVOR OF CASE-BYCASE ADJUDICATION ON THE MERITS. SECOND, THE ARTICLE LOCATES SUCH ADJUDICATION WITHIN THE MODERN TREND TOWARD TRANSNATIONALISM, A TREND THAT UNITES INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW WITH HUMAN RIGHTS LAW. IN LIGHT OF THESE OBSERVATIONS, THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT INTERNATIONAL ADJUDICATION OF LAND DISPUTES MAY CONTRIBUTE TO SUCH HUMAN VALUES AS DEVELOPMENT, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE RULE OF LAW.
946	REGULATORY GAMESMANSHIP TYPICALLY RELIES ON A PLANNING TECHNIQUE KNOWN AS REGULATORY ARBITRAGE, WHICH OCCURS WHEN PARTIES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A GAP BETWEEN THE ECONOMICS OF A DEAL AND ITS REGULATORY TREATMENT, RESTRUCTURING THE DEAL TO REDUCE OR AVOID REGULATORY COSTS WITHOUT UNDULY ALTERING THE UNDERLYING ECONOMICS OF THE DEAL THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE THEORY OF REGULATORY ARBITRAGE, IDENTIFYING THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH ARBITRAGE TAKES PLACE AND THE VARIOUS LEGAL, BUSINESS, PROFESSIONAL, ETHICAL, AND POLITICAL CONSTRAINTS ON ARBITRAGE THIS THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK REVEALS HOW REGULATORY ARBITRAGE DISTORTS REGULATORY COMPETITION, SHIFTS THE INCIDENCE OF REGULATORY COSTS, AND FOSTERS A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW

948	IN 2013, HER MAJESTY'S CUSTOMS AND REVENUE (THE HMRC) GAINED SIGNIFICANT POWERS IN TACKLING THE ISSUE OF TAX AVOIDANCE IN THE FORM OF FOLLOWER NOTICES (FN) AND ACCELERATED PAYMENT NOTICES (APN). THIS HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE TAXPAYING COMMUNITY. FOR INSTANCE, IN THE TAX YEAR 2016/2017 ALONE, THE HMRC ACCUMULATED GBP 520M IN ADDITIONAL REVENUE THROUGH THESE POWERS. MANY PRACTITIONERS AND JUDGES HAVE VOICED THEIR CRITICISM AGAINST THE POWERS BUT HAVE YET TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNT OF THE INADEQUACIES OF THESE NOTICES. THEIR VERY NATURE IS PUNITIVE, AND THEY ARE OVERLY BROAD FOR THEIR INTENDED TARGET, SPECIFICALLY, AGGRESSIVE TAX PLANNERS. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, TAXPAYERS ARE LEFT WITHOUT EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL SAFEGUARDS. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO EXPLAIN THAT BOTH NOTICES ARE AN AFFRONT TO JUSTICE BY FOCUSING ON THESE ASPECTS. MOREOVER, THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO SHED LIGHT ON RECENT CASES SUCH AS HAWORTH THAT DEMONSTRATE THAT THE JUDICIARY IS PREPARED TO SHOW SOME RESISTANCE AGAINST THESE NOTICES. WHILE THE CASE PROVIDES A GLIMMER OF HOPE FOR TAXPAYERS, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT JUDICIAL INTERVENTION ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH; PARLIAMENTARY INTERVENTION IS ALSO NEEDED.
949	THE SUPREME COURT'S OPINION IN BOSTOCK V. CLAYTON COUNTY, GEORGIA RECOGNIZING THAT ANTI-GAY AND ANTI-TRANS DISCRIMINATION ARE FORMS OF SEX DISCRIMINATION UNDER TITLE VII OF THE 1964 CIVIL RIGHTS ACT HAS ALREADY GAINED A STEADY REPUTATION AS A TEXTUALIST STATUTORY INTERPRETATION DECISION. THE REALITY OF THE RULING IS FAR MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT. BOSTOCK IS A TEXTUALIST DECISION, BUT, AS THE ARGUMENT HERE SHOWS, BOSTOCK ALSO OFFERS A CONSTRUCTION OF TITLE VIPS SEX DISCRIMINATION RULE THAT SOUNDS IN A RULE-OF-LAW NORM OF LEGAL JUSTICE ABOUT LGBT EQUALITY THAT ITSELF TRACES ROOTS TO THE SUPREME COURT'S CONSTITUTIONAL LGBT RIGHTS JURISPRUDENCE. BOSTOCK'S RULE-OF-LAW NORM OF LEGAL JUSTICE, WHICH EXPANDS AND DIFFUSES CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS OF LGBT EQUALITY IN NEW WAYS, DOES MORE THAN SHAPE BOSTOCK 'S INTERPRETATION OF TITLE VII. THROUGH IT, BOSTOCK SUPPLIES STATE ACTORS, INCLUDING COURTS, WITH INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO TREAT ALL CLAIMS OF LESBIAN, GAY, AND NOW TRANS RIGHTS, WHETHER THEY FORMALLY INVOLVE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS CLAIMS OR, AS IN BOSTOCK, DO NOT. IN BOSTOCK'S WAKE, STATE ACTORS MUST ORDINARILY TREAT LGBT PERSONS JUST THE SAME AS THEIR CISHETEROSEXUAL COUNTERPARTS, AFFORDING THEM THE SAME BENEFITS OF ESTABLISHED AND NEW LEGAL PROTECTIONS THAT CISHETEROSEXUALS RECEIVE. THE PATH TO THIS LARGER PICTURE PROCEEDS THROUGH AN ACCOUNT THAT EXPLAINS BOSTOCK BOTH IS AND IS NOT A TEXTUALIST DECISION. THE OPINION'S TEXTUALIST SELF-ACCOUNTING, TRACKED IN THESE PAGES, LACKS NORMATIVE JUSTIFICATORY PUNCH ON THE CENTRAL INTERPRETIVE QUESTION RAISED BY THE CLAIMS IT DECIDES: WHETHER TITLE VII'S SEX DISCRIMINATION BAN COVERS ANTI GAY AND ANTI-TRANS DISCRIMINATION. A CAREFUL READING OF BOSTOCK SHOWS THE OPINION BOTH DISPARAGING AND THEN ULTIMATELY EMBRACING "EXTRATEXTUAL" REASONS FOR CHOOSING TO READ TITLE VII'S SEX DISCRIMINATION RULE IN THE PRO -GAY AND PRO -TRANS DIRECTIONS THAT IT DOES. THE MOST TELLING OF THESE REASONS, IN A DRAMATIC TURN, ABANDONS THE MAJORITY'S TEXTUALIST HUNT, AND REACHES FOR A GENERAL, RULE-OF-LAW IDEAL OF LEGAL JUSTICE A DISTINCTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF FORMAL EQUALITY INVOLVING LGBT PERSONS THAT EMERGES FROM, AND EXTENDS TO NEW LEVELS, THE LEGAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT'S PRO-LESBIAN AND PRO-GAY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS JURISPRUDENCE, WHOSE PRO-TRANS LEGAL IMPLICATIONS ARE EXPRESSLY RECOGNIZED BY THE SUPREME COURT IN BOSTOCK FOR THE FIRST TIME. BOSTOCK'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE OPERATIONS OF LEGAL JUSTICE IN THE CASE A STYLIZED EXTENSION OF OPERATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS HAS FARREACHING IMPLICATIONS FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF OTHER STATUTES THAT MAY BENEFIT LGBT PERSONS, AS WELL AS OTHER LEGAL RULES THAT, NOW OR IN THE FUTURE, IMPLICATE LGBT RIGHTS. UNDERSTANDING HOW BOSTOCK FOLLOWS A LINE OFJUSTIFICATION FOUND IN THE SUPREME COURT'S CONSTITUTIONAL PROMISES OF EQUAL DIGNITY AND RESPECT FOR LESBIAN WOMEN, GAY MEN, AND TRANS PEOPLE FRAMES AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT IS LEGALLY MISGUIDED ABOUT THE TEXTUALIST APPROACHES TAKEN UP BY THE BOSTOCK DISSENTS. THESE OPINIONS, WHICH INDULGE BOTH ANTI-GAY AND ANTI TRANS SENTIMENTS AS TOUCHSTONES FOR THEIR OWN PREFERRED CHOICES FOR HOW TO READ TITLE VIPS SEX DISCRIMINATION BAN, FLOUT CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES THAT STRIP THOSE CHOICES OF THEIR OWN EASY CLAIMS TO LEGALITY. HAVING IDENTIFIED THE LEGAL FLAWS OF THE DISSENTS' TEXTUALIST ANALYTICS, DISCUSSION TURNS TO THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THE LIKELY REASONS WHY THE BOSTOCK MAJORITY OPINION DOES NOT EXPRESSLY AVOW THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND RULE-OF-LAW GROUNDS FOR ITS DECISION. NO MATTER, THE RECOGNITION OF BOSTOCK'S FOUNDATIONS IN CONSTITUTIONALISM RECASTS THE PRESSURES THE SUPREME COURT WILL FACE IN FUTURE CASES TAKING UP QUESTIONS THAT BOSTOCK FORMALLY BRACKETS, AS WELL AS OTHER WONDERS ABOUT ITS OWN TEXT'S MEANING. WITH TIME, BOSTOCK MAY PROVE TO BE AN EVEN BIGGER BREAKTHROUGH FOR LGBT EQUALITY AND RIGHTS UNDER LAW THAN AT FIRST GLANCE IT SEEMS.
950	CHINA HAS BECOME A RECENT RISING POWER IN GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. THIS PAPER EXAMINES HOW THE GLOBAL NORTH, AS REPRESENTED BY JAPAN, RESPONDS TO THE RISING OF THE GLOBAL SOUTH, AS REPRESENTED BY CHINA, IN INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT. THIS PAPER POSITIONS ITSELF IN THE CONTEXT OF GLOBAL-NORTH/SOUTH AND TRIANGULAR COOPERATION TO COMPARE JAPAN'S PARTNERSHIP FOR QUALITY INFRASTRUCTURE WITH CHINA'S BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE FROM THE DIMENSIONS OF POLICY RHETORIC, FINANCE MECHANISM, ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY AND RULE OF LAW. THIS PAPER DRAWS THE CONCLUSION ON WHETHER THE NORTH-SOUTH COMPETITION ENHANCES THE QUALITY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF THOSE INITIATIVES.
951	THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES TO ANALYZE EUTHANASIA FROM A SOCIO-LEGAL ANGLE, UNDERSTANDING THAT IF THERE IS A LEGAL AND MEDICAL FRAMEWORK IN COLOMBIA THAT ADDRESSES THIS PRACTICE, THE EVIDENCE REVEALS THAT VARIOUS CULTURAL, INSTITUTIONAL, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ELEMENTS PERMEATED THE APPLICATION, CREATING AN AUTHENTIC LEGAL PROBLEM, WITH SEVERE CONNOTATIONS IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS AND THE SOCIAL RULE OF LAW. TO CARRY OUT THIS ANALYSIS, A JOINT INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL, THEORETICAL, MEDICAL, SCIENTIFIC AND JOURNALISTIC ELEMENTS WAS CARRIED OUT THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING OF ACCESS TO EUTHANASIA AND OF THE BODILY REALITY OF THE PATIENT AS A SUBJECT OF LAW.
952	THIS RESEARCH EXAMINES THE IMPACTS OF FDI INFLOWS, INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY (IQ) AND THEIR INTERACTION ON INCOME INEQUALITY IN 36 ASIAN COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 2000-2018. RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT FDI EXACERBATES INCOME INEQUALITY, AND THE IMPROVEMENT IN IQ FROM FDI DIMINISHES THIS DETRIMENTAL IMPACT UNTIL A THRESHOLD OF IQ, THEN BEYOND THAT FDI REDUCES INCOME INEQUALITY. MEANWHILE, INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY REDUCES INCOME INEQUALITY, AND THIS BENEFICIAL EFFECT IS INTENSIFIED WITH THE RISING FDI INFLOWS. NOTABLY, IQ MODERATES THE IMPACT OF FDI ON INCOME INEQUALITY THROUGH THE INTERNAL MECHANISM OF GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE/TERRORISM, AND RULE OF LAW.
953	EVEN AFTER THE FEDERAL STATUTE N. 13.129/15 HAS CLEARLY AUTHORIZED THE USE OF ARBITRATION BY PUBLIC ENTITIES, DISCUSSIONS REGARDING SOME SORT OF OFFENSE TO THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE STILL REMAIN. THE MAIN SCHOLAR OBJECTIONS TO THE THESIS SUSTAIN THAT THE USE OF ARBITRATION WITHIN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION WOULD VIOLATE THE PRINCIPLE OF UNAVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC INTEREST. FOR THIS REASON, THIS PAPER AIMS TO ANALYZE THE PRINCIPLE OF PUBLIC INTEREST FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ITS UNAVAILABILITY AND SUPREMACY, IN ACCORDANCE DO BRAZILIAN LEGAL SYSTEM, POINTING SOME DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE EFFECTS ON THE USE OF ARBITRATION BY PUBLIC ENTITIES. THE METHODOLOGY HERE USED WAS THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REVIEW ON THE TOPIC.
954	WHILE GIOVANNI DA LEGNANO'S DE BELLO (CA.1360) DEALS PRIMARILY WITH PRACTICAL ISSUES RELATED TO THE LAW OF WAR, HE ALSO DELVED INTO THE AREAS OF MORAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY BY EXAMINING THE CARDINAL VIRTUE FORTITUDE. GIOVANNI'S INTEREST IN FORTITUDE CONTINUES LONGSTANDING MEDIEVAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE MORALITY OF WAR AND OTHER FORMS OF SANCTIONED VIOLENCE, BUT HIS APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT IS THAT OF A JURIST ATTEMPTING TO BRING LICIT VIOLENCE MORE FIRMLY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT IN WHICH HE WROTE, FURTHERMORE, PROVIDES A USEFUL FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING HIS MOTIVATIONS AND HIS TREATMENT OF VARIOUS ISSUES IN THE WORK.
955	WHILE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPRS) ARE THE KEY DRIVERS OF ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN R&D BASED GROWTH MODELS, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY EXPLORED IN EMPIRICAL DEVELOPMENT STUDIES. WE INTRODUCE IPRS TO THIS LITERATURE, USING TWO-STAGE LEAST SQUARES BAYESIAN MODEL AVERAGING TO ADDRESS ENDOGENEITY AND MODEL UNCERTAINTY AT THE INSTRUMENT AND INCOME STAGES. WE SHOW THAT IPRS EXERT EFFECTS SIMILAR TO 'RULE OF LAW' AND THEREFORE PROVIDE ROBUST EVIDENCE THAT BOTH PHYSICAL AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE CRUCIAL DEVELOPMENT DETERMINANTS. WE DOCUMENT THAT UNENFORCED IPRS EXERT NO EFFECT ON DEVELOPMENT. INSTEAD, IT IS THE LEVEL OF ENFORCED IPRS THAT CAUSES DEVELOPMENT. JEL CLASSIFICATION: O1, C1
956	BY EXPOSING MILITARY LEADERS TO DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND WORKING TO FOSTER RESPECT FOR CIVILIAN AUTHORITY AND MILITARY PROFESSIONALISM, [FOREIGN MILITARY TRAINING] PROVIDES A WINDOWS, THROUGH WHICH WE CALL POSITIVELY INFLUENCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF FOREIGN MILITARY, INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR ROLE ILL A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. WHILE SUCH ENGAGEMENT CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO GUARANTEE A PERFECT HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD OIL THE PART OF ANY MILITARY FORCE, IT NONETHELESS REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO ENCOURAGE ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW RESPECT FOR BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS, AND APPROPRIATE PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT IN THE FACE OF INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL CHALLENGES. -DEPARTMENT OF STATE, BUREAU OF POLITICAL-MILITARY AFFAIRS, MARCH 1, 2000.
957	THE ECONOMICS LITERATURE GENERALLY FINDS A POSITIVE, BUT SMALL, GAIN IN INCOME TO NATIVE-BORN POPULATIONS FROM IMMIGRANTS AND POTENTIALLY LARGE GAINS IN WORLD INCOMES. BUT IMMIGRANTS CAN ALSO IMPACT A RECIPIENT NATION'S INSTITUTIONS. A GROWING EMPIRICAL LITERATURE SUPPORTS THE IMPORTANCE OF STRONG PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS, A RULE OF LAW, AND AN ENVIRONMENT OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM FOR PROMOTING LONG-RUN PROSPERITY. BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW IMMIGRATION IMPACTS THESE INSTITUTIONS. THIS PAPER EMPIRICALLY EXAMINES HOW IMMIGRATION IMPACTS A NATION'S POLICIES AND INSTITUTIONS. WE FIND NO EVIDENCE OF NEGATIVE AND SOME EVIDENCE OF POSITIVE IMPACTS IN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AS A RESULT OF IMMIGRATION.
958	LEGISLATURES SOMETIMES INTERFERE IN JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS WHEN THEY EXPECT THE OUTCOME TO BE POLITICALLY UNDESIRABLE. THE RESULTING AD HOC LAWS ARE APPLICABLE IN CASES KNOWN IN ADVANCE, ALTHOUGH THEY MAY APPEAR TO BE NEUTRAL, GENERAL AND PROSPECTIVE. SUCH LAWS FORCE THE COURTS TO DECIDE THE CASE IN FAVOR OF THE STATE, MAKING CONTINUED LITIGATION POINTLESS FOR THE OTHER PARTY. LEGISLATION OF THIS KIND MAY SERIOUSLY THREATEN THE RULE OF LAW, FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL AND THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. IN THIS ARTICLE, RECENT EXAMPLES WILL BE PRESENTED, EXPLAINING AND COMPARING THE POSITION OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE U.S. SUPREME COURT.
959	THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES AND EXAMINES 5 CONUNDRUMS CONFRONTING THERAPEUTIC JURISPRUDENCE. IS THERAPEUTIC JURISPRUDENCE DISTINGUISHABLE FROM OTHER JURISPRUDENCES THAT SHARE ITS GOAL OF USING THE LAW TO IMPROVE THE WELL-BEING OF OTHERS (THE IDENTITY DILEMMA)? CAN THE TERM THERAPEUTIC BE DEFINED IN A MEANINGFUL WAY (THE DEFINITIONAL DILEMMA)? WILL THE VAGARIES OF EMPIRICAL RESEARCH, ON WHICH THERAPEUTIC JURISPRUDENCE HEAVILY RELIES, DOOM ITS PROPOSALS (THE DILEMMA OF EMPIRICAL INDETERMINACY)? HOW WILL A THERAPEUTIC JURISPRUDENCE PROPOSAL THAT BENEFITS ONLY A SUBGROUP OF THOSE IT AFFECTS BE IMPLEMENTED (THE RULE OF LAW DILEMMA)? WHEN AND HOW SHOULD A THERAPEUTIC JURISPRUDENCE PROPOSAL BE BALANCED AGAINST COUNTERVAILING CONSTITUTIONAL AND SOCIAL POLICIES (THE BALANCING DILEMMA)?
960	THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE THE IMPACT OF INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW RULES IN THE ECONOMIC CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, ESPECIALLY THOSE INCLUDED IN INVESTMENT CHAPTERS OF PERUVIAN'S FREE TRADE TREATIES. IN PARTICULAR, IT IS EXPECTED TO DEMONSTRATE THE FOLLOWING (I) INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW IS PART OF PERUVIAN LEGAL SYSTEM; (II) PROVISIONS OF THESE LAWS ARE MANDATORY AND SHOULD BE APPLIED DOMESTICALLY; AND (III) INTERPRETATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS LEGAL RIGHT SHOULD BE EXECUTED CONSISTENTLY WITH DOMESTIC LEGAL SYSTEM AND PERUVIAN INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS. THIS AGREED INTERPRETATION BETWEEN INVESTMENT LAW AND ECONOMIC CONSTITUTION WILL HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT IN RATIONALIZATION OF PUBLIC ENTITIES ACTIONS AVOIDING ABUSES AND MALTREATMENT TO INVESTORS, IN ORDER TO IMPROVE INVESTMENT CLIMATE AS A KEY ELEMENT FOR ACHIEVING COUNTRY'S SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.
961	THIS REFLECTION CONSIDERS WHY POLAND'S AND HUNGARY'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS REMAINED IN MANY WAYS UNAFFECTED BY WIDESPREAD, SERIOUS, AND DOCUMENTED ACTIONS ON THE PART OF THOSE TWO GOVERNMENTS WHICH HAVE GRAVELY WEAKENED THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY, AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THE REFLECTION DOES NOT ARGUE FOR EXPULSION OF THESE STATES, BUT INVESTIGATES WHY IT IS THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION'S POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS AND ACTORS (RATHER THAN ITS SUPRANATIONAL BODIES) HAVE NOT BEEN WILLING TO CONFRONT POLAND AND HUNGARY MORE ROBUSTLY. THE WILLINGNESS OF EU ACTORS TO OVERLOOK GROWING AUTHORITARIANISM IN POLAND SINCE THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE HIGHLIGHTS THESE CONCERNS EVEN MORE STARKLY.
962	THE DIALECTIC TENSION BETWEEN THE PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE AND LEGALITY IS AN INTRINSIC COMPONENT OF CRIMINAL LAW. WHEN SERIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS COMMITTED BY A PREVIOUS AUTHORITARIAN REGIME ARE PROSECUTED IN DOMESTIC LEGAL SYSTEMS, THIS TENSION BECOMES EVEN MORE EVIDENT. WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW THIS ISSUE, INHERENT TO TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE, CAN FIND VARIOUS SOLUTIONS LEADING TO RADICALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS: FROM IMPUNITY TO PROSECUTIONS WITHOUT FAIR TRIAL GUARANTEES. THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THESE TWO PRINCIPLES IS ANALYSED IN THIS PAPER, AS WELL AS LEGAL TECHNIQUES AND FLEXIBLE INTERPRETATIONS AIMING THE RECONCILIATION OF THE COMPETING DEMANDS OF JUSTICE AND LEGALITY IN TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE CONTEXTS.
963	POLITICAL RELATIONS BETWEEN POLAND AND GERMANY ARE BAD. THEY ARE MARKED BY DISAGREEMENT AND ALIENATION. SO, THIS IS A GOOD TIME FOR POLITICAL CARTOONS. TRADITIONALLY, THESE ARE DEVOTED TO PEOPLE AND ISSUES FROM DOMESTIC POLITICS. BUT THE DEBATES ABOUT POLAND'S HANDLING OF REFUGEES FROM THE MIDDLE EAST, THE DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN BRUSSELS AND WARSAW OVER THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE DEATH OF THOUSANDS OF FISH IN THE ODER RIVER IN AUGUST 2022 PROVIDE CARTOONISTS WITH PLENTY OF MATERIAL. SOME RELY ON THE FUNCTION OF CARICATURE AS A MEANS OF EXPOSING POLITICAL FOLLY AND CORRUPTION, WHILE OTHERS ALLOW THEIR ART TO BE USED FOR PROPAGANDA.
964	THE EMPHASIS OF TWENTY-SEVENTH AND EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY THINKERS TO DEFEND RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE IS WELL KNOWN. TODAY, CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MAINSTAYS OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, DISCUSSIONS ABOUT TOLERANCE WENT A LONG WAY TOWARDS ITS RECOGNITION AS A CIVIC VIRTUE. THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO DISCUSS THE NOTIONS OF OPINION AND OBSTINACY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF POLITICS AND PHILOSOPHY, ESPECIALLY IN THE WORKS OF JOHN LOCKE AND PIERRE BAYLE. THE CONCLUSION SHOWS THAT THIS DEBATE BRINGS FRUITFUL REFLECTIONS CAPABLE OF ENLIGHTENING CERTAIN CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL DEBATES, MORE PRECISELY THE OMNIPRESENCE OF MATERIAL AND SYMBOLIC VIOLENCE GENERATED BY THE OBSTINACY AND BY THE DISSEMINATION OF FUNDAMENTALISMS IN SOCIAL NETWORKS.
965	THE 'LONG PEACE' OF THE LAST TWENTY-FIVE YEARS HAS LINKED VARIOUS FORMS OF INTERVENTION-FROM DEVELOPMENT TO PEACEBUILDING AND HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION-WITH HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS 'INTERVENTIONARY SYSTEM/ORDER' MODEL HAS PREMISED ITS LEGITIMATE AUTHORITY ON EXPANDED VERSIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, CONNECTED TO LIBERAL FRAMEWORKS OF DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW, AND CAPITALISM IN ORDER TO CONNECT PEACE MORE CLOSELY WITH JUSTICE. HUMAN RIGHTS OFFER A TACTICAL WAY FORWARD FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN CONFLICT RESOLUTION, BUT THIS HAS LED TO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. UNLESS CONCEPTIONS OF RIGHTS ARE CONTINUALLY EXPANDED AS NEW POWER STRUCTURES AND INEQUALITIES ARE UNCOVERED AND CHALLENGED, PHILOSOPHICAL AND MATERIAL MATTERS OF DISTRIBUTIVE AND HISTORICAL JUSTICE WILL REMAIN.
966	DONALD TRUMP EMBODIES POPULISM - A POLITICAL PHENOMENON OFTEN REDUCED TO A CONTINGENT PATHOLOGY OF WESTERN POLITICS. THIS PAPER, INSTEAD, CONCEIVES OF POPULISM AS A COMMUNICATIVE DEVICE ESPECIALLY SUITABLE FOR A MEDIATISED POLITICS. HERE SUCH A DEVICE IS IDENTIFIED ON THE BASIS OF FIVE INDICES, ALLOWING TO QUALIFY IT AS MORE OR LESS POPULIST: 1) DIRECT APPEAL TO PEOPLE, 2) ANTI-PLURALISM, 3) PERSONALIZATION OF LEADERSHIP, 4) MEDIATISATION, 5) COMMUNICATIVE SIMPLIFICATION. POPULISM AND TRUMPISM REPRESENT A CHALLENGE TO CONSTITUTIONALISM: RULE OF LAW, NEW CONSTITUTIONALISM AND NEOCOSTITUTIONALISM, SEPARATELY AND JOINTLY. A CHALLENGE ANNOUNCING AN ENTROPIC STATE, WITH THE FORM OF A CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT AND THE SUBSTANCE OF A SECURITY AND A NEOLIBERAL STATE.
967	EU-JAPAN COOPERATION ON ISSUES RELATED TO SECURITY INCLUDES EFFORTS FOR ERADICATING TERRORISM, COORDINATING POLICY, AND WORKING TOGETHER IN CRISIS MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS. THE EU AND JAPAN SHARE THE SAME VALUES AND ARE SOCIETIES BASED ON DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, AND THEY HAVE SIMILAR APPROACHES TO REGIONAL AND GLOBAL PEACE AND STABILITY. IN 2015 THE THREE FOCUS AREAS ARE EU-JAPAN COOPERATION FOR GLOBAL PEACE AND STABILITY, COOPERATION FOR CONTRIBUTING TO ADDRESSING GLOBAL CHALLENGES, AND THE PROMOTION OF THE STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP. THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT BILATERAL COOPERATION BETWEEN THE EU AND JAPAN WILL ENCOURAGE MULTILATERAL COMMITMENT FOR GLOBAL COOPERATION TO RESOLVE GLOBAL PROBLEMS.
968	ALL LAW IS INTENDED TO ACHIEVE THE COMMON GOOD. WITHIN THIS INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK, JUSTICE IS THE SUPREME VALUE THAT SEEKS TO ENSURE THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY. WHEN IS IT POSSIBLE TO SAY THAT IT IS ACTING ACCORDING TO JUSTICE? FINDING AN ANSWER REQUIRES GOING BACK TO THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES THAT HAVE GIVEN RISE TO ANY LEGAL FORMULATION. AND BEHIND THESE PRINCIPLES IS THE PERSON ORDERING THE FINAL RECIPIENT. THE WRITTEN POLICY IS NOT BASED (AT LEAST SHOULD NOT BE) IN RANDOM OR POLITICAL IDEAS OF GOVERNMENT. FACED WITH THE IMMINENT PRESENCE OF A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO RETURN TO THE ULTIMATE FOUNDATIONS OF ALL RULE OF LAW.
969	IN ARISTOTLE'S POLITICS BOOK 4, THE READER FINDS A FORM OF CORRECT CONSTITUTION (HE MESE POLITEIA) THAT OCCURS WHEN THE CITIZENS WITH MODERATE RESOURCES, THE "MIDDLING" CLASS OR MESOI, ARE NOT ONLY NUMEROUS, BUT THE MAJORITY. ACCORDING TO ARISTOTLE, THIS CLASS GUARANTEES THE RULE OF LAW AND REASON, LAYS THE FOUNDATION OF FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN CITIZENS, AND SO, ENSURES THE REGIME'S STABILITY. IN THIS ESSAY 1 EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP EXISTING BETWEEN THIS CONSTITUTIONAL FORM AND, FIRST, POLITY, UNDERSTOOD AS A COMBINATION OF DEMOCRACY AND OLIGARCHY: SECOND, DEMOCRACY. AS THE GOVERNMENT OF THE MANY: AND, FINALLY, ARISTE POLITEIA BASED ON THE VIRTUE OF ITS CITIZENS.
970	THIS ARTICLE INTERROGATES THE MEANING OF KYUKYAW, OFTEN SHORTENED AS KYU, A BURMESE WORD THAT IS USED AS BOTH A VERB-TO OCCUPY OR ENCROACH-AND A NOUN-SQUATTER OR SLUM. THIS DEPLOYMENT OF LANGUAGE DEMANDS ATTENTION BECAUSE KYU EVOKES STRONG NEGATIVE SENTIMENTS, DESPITE ITS AMBIGUITY. THE RAPID PACE OF CHANGE IN POST JUNTA MYANMAR HAS COMPELLED BOTH THE ELITE AND THE MARGINALIZED TO SEEK RIGHTNESS THROUGH THE NOTION OF RULE OF LAW, EVEN THOUGH CUSTOMARY PRACTICES HAVE NOT ADHERED TO THE STRICTURES OF MANMADE LAW. THROUGH THE PERSONAL NARRATIVES OF RESIDENTS IN HLAINGTHAYA TOWNSHIP IN YANGON, THIS ARTICLE RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT RIGHTFUL SETTLEMENT IN UNCLEAR LEGAL FRAME-WORKS.
971	THROUGH USE OF A RECENT STUDY RESEARCHING DEMOCRATIC EDUCATION AND CITIZENSHIP IN ZIMBABWE, THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE METHODOLOGICAL DILEMMAS AND CHALLENGES FACED BY AN ETHNOGRAPHER, PARTICULARLY BY A RESEARCH STUDENT IN A VIOLENT CONTEXT. THE ARTICLE POSITS A BRICOLAGE STRATEGY TO NAVIGATE SOME OF THE DANGERS AND METHODOLOGICAL DILEMMAS INHERENT SO AS TO BRING ABOUT RIGOUR IN AN ENVIRONMENT EMPTY OF CONVENTION AND LACKING THE RULE OF LAW. TO NAVIGATE SUCH SOCIETIES RIDDEN WITH VIOLENCE AND CONFLICT, THE BRICOLAGE STRATEGY USED A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH, PART OF WHICH INCLUDED TRIANGULATION, MIXED METHODS, DISTANCE AND INSIDER STATUS. THESE RESEARCH STRATEGIES ARE DISCUSSED IN THIS PAPER AND RECOMMENDATIONS POSITED.
972	WHY DID A GRADUALIST TRANSITION APPROACH ACHIEVE DIFFERENT PERFORMANCES AMONG SOCIALIST ECONOMIES IN THE 1980S? WHY DID SOME SOCIALIST ECONOMIES NEVER TRY A GRADUALIST APPROACH TO ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION? THIS PAPER DEVELOPS A MODEL TO SHOW THAT THE LIBERALIZATION OF A SOCIALIST ECONOMY HAS TWO OPPOSITE EFFECTS ON THE RENT CAPTURED BY GOVERNMENT. THE INITIAL ECONOMIC CONDITION DETERMINES THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE TWO EFFECTS, AND CONSEQUENTLY THE TRANSITION PATH AND PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, A GRADUALIST REFORM STRATEGY ADOPTED BY A RENT-SEEKING GOVERNMENT CANNOT FINISH THE TRANSITION TOWARD A COMPLETE MARKET ECONOMY. TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL, A NEW CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE NECESSARY.
973	POLICING, A SUBJECT LITTLE STUDIED BY NORTH AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENTISTS, HAS CONSIDERABLE RELEVANCE TO NEWLY DEMOCRATIZING COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY THOSE EMERGING FROM COMMUNIST RULE. TAKING THE CASE OF UKRAINE, THE ARTICLE EXAMINES WHAT MEASURES HAVE BEEN ADOPTED TO TRANSFORM THAT COUNTRY'S SOVIET PATTERN OF AUTHORITARIAN POLICING INTO SOMETHING RESEMBLING THAT OF ESTABLISHED EUROPEAN LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES. THE BALANCE SHEET SHOWS FEW SIGNS OF POSITIVE CHANGE. INSTEAD, THANKS TO PRESIDENT LEONID KUCHMA'S LEADERSHIP, THE POLITICIZATION AND CORRUPTION OF THE POLICE IS NOW MORE BLATANT THAN EVER. A NEW FORM OF POLICE STATE, NOT SEEN IN THE NINETEENTH OR TWENTIETH CENTURIES, THREATENS THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY ALONG WITH IT.
974	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO VERIFY, WITH A FOCUS ON IVES GANDRA MARTINS' THESIS ON ART. 142 OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION AND THROUGH THE HYPOTHETICAL-DEDUCTIVE METHOD, THE POSSIBILITY OF A CONSTITUTIONAL MILITARY INTERVENTION WITHIN THE BRAZILIAN LEGAL SYSTEM, THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT, THE OPINIONS OF THE DOCTRINE, AND THE FRAMERS' ORIGINAL INTENT ON THE MATTER. AT THE END OF THE STUDY, WE CONCLUDE THAT THE REFERRED INTERVENTION IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE BRAZILIAN LEGAL SYSTEM SINCE IT WOULD IMPLY A SUBSTITUTION OF THE SUPREME COURT BY THE MILITARY AS THE ULTIMATE INTERPRETERS OF THE CONSTITUTION, WHICH BY ITS TURN WOULD UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW IN BRAZIL.
975	THE ARTICLE REVEALS THE PROBLEMS OF MODERN TERRORISM, WHICH HAS SPREAD ALMOST ALL OVER THE WORLD. POLITICAL AND LEGAL DOCUMENTS OF INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL NATURE WERE REVIEWED AND ANALYSED, INCLUDING 1937 UNITED NATIONS (UN) CONVENTION FOR THE PREVENTION AND PUNISHMENT OF TERRORISM, THE UN COUNTER-TERRORISM STRATEGY, THE STRATEGY "KAZAKHSTAN-2050", AND THE LEGISLATION OF THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN. A NUMBER OF CONSOLIDATED MEASURES ARE PROPOSED THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR MORE EFFECTIVE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM. STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW AND LEGAL SUPERVISION, MORE ACTIVE USE OF LEGAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR TRAINING AND EDUCATION WILL, TO A LARGE EXTENT, CONTRIBUTE TO THE FRUITFUL SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE PREVENTION OF TERRORISM.
976	THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS IS THE MAJOR GOAL OF HUMANITY, THIS MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH EFFORTS HAD TRIED TO FIND ITS DETERMINANTS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE ROLE OF DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY OF HAPPINESS FOR 33 ASIAN COUNTRIES. QUALITY OF INSTITUTES HELPS PEOPLE FEEL A SENSE OF CONTROL AND ACHIEVEMENT, WHICH MAY LEAD TO PERCEIVED WELLBEING. THIS STUDY HAS USED A PANEL FGLS MODEL. THE RESULTS CONFIRMED THAT GOOD GOVERNANCE, MONEY, OPENNESS, AND EMPLOYMENT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON HAPPINESS. IT IS URGED THAT IMPROVEMENT IN INDICATORS LIKE REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW TO PROMOTE EMPLOYMENT AND TRADE OPENNESS WHICH MAY HELP IN NATIONAL HAPPINESS.
977	IN THE ELECTIONS IN SLOVAKIA AT THE END OF FEBRUARY 2020, THE GOVERNING COALITION LEAD BY THE SOCIAL DEMOCRAT SMER PARTY LOST POWER, WHILE THE OLANO ANTI-CORRUPTION MOVEMENT WON. DIAN BENEFITED MOST STRONGLY FROM THE SHOCKED REACTION AMONG THE POPULATION TO THE CORRUPTION AND SUBVERSION OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT EMERGED DURING THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE MURDER OF THE JOURNALIST JAN KUCIAK. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW MADE UP OF FOUR PARTIES LED BY THE ANTI-CORRUPTION ACTIVIST IGOR MATOVIA. POPULIST POLITICIANS WILL CONTINUE TO DOMINATE THE PARLIAMENT AND GOVERNMENT IN THE FUTURE. THERE WILL BE NO FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE OF DIRECTION OR NEW POLITICAL CULTURE IN SLOVAKIA.
978	MORAL DIALOGUES ARE ONE MECHANISM OF CULTURAL CHANGE, ALLOWING COMMUNITIES TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS AND REVISE THE FUNDAMENTAL NORMS AND VALUES GOVERNING THEIR MEMBERS' RELATIONSHIPS. THIS ESSAY ILLUSTRATES THE MORAL DIALOGUE PROCESS WITH THE DEBATES OVER SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE TRUMP ERA. VICTIMIZED WOMEN LAUNCHED A TRANSNATIONAL "MEGALOGUE" THAT PERVADED POLITICS, BUSINESS, ENTERTAINMENT, ACADEMIA, AND OTHER SPHERES. IT TRANSFORMED NORMS, INSTITUTIONS, AND ENFORCEMENT OF ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR IN EMPLOYMENT AND IN PUBLIC, RESULTING IN A NEW SHARED MORAL UNDERSTANDING. HOWEVER, THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT IS NOT PUNISHED FOR IMMORALITY DEMONSTRATES THAT NORMATIVE CHANGE ULTIMATELY REQUIRES THE RULE OF LAW. (C) 2018 WESTERN SOCIAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION.

979	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES WHETHER THERE ARE SUBSTANTIVE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN JUDGMENT WRITING IN INTERMEDIATE AND FINAL COURTS OF APPEAL. IT CONCLUDES THAT ANY DIFFERENCES ARE STRUCTURAL, RATHER THAN RELATED TO FUNCTION. FINAL COURTS HAVE FEWER CASES AND THUS MORE TIME FOR CONSIDERATION. AND FINAL COURTS ARE JUST THAT - FINAL. AS TO FUNCTION, MOST CASES REACHING A FINAL COURT WILL HAVE PASSED THROUGH AN INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEAL. THIS MEANS THAT BOTH LEVELS OF COURT SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SAFEGUARDING THE RULE OF LAW AND FOR DEVELOPING THE LAW WHERE THIS IS APPROPRIATE. AND ALL LEVELS OF COURT IN THE SYSTEM SHARE THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF DOING JUSTICE BETWEEN THE PARTIES ACCORDING TO LAW.
980	THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MEXICAN MEDIA, BOTH BROADCAST AND PRINT, THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF THEIR CURRENT LEGAL FRAMEWORK, CULTURE, OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE AND COMMON PRACTICES. IT IS BASED ON ARCHIVAL RESEARCH, INTERVIEWS AND A REVIEW OF THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE. ITS ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK IS BASED ON CONCEPTS OF THE THEORY OF DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY DEVELOPED BY CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHERS SUCH AS JURGEN HABERMAS, JAMES BOHMAN, JANE MANSBRIDGE AND JOSHUA COHEN. WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK, IT ARGUES THAT THE MAJOR OBSTACLES TO DEMOCRACY IN MEXICO, WHICH INCLUDE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC INEQUALITIES, PATRONAGE AND A WEAK RULE OF LAW, ALSO CONSTITUTE OBSTACLES TO THE DELIBERATIVE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MEXICAN MEDIA.
981	WE PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY OF THE RECENT LITERATURE ON THE LINK BETWEEN PRODUCTIVE GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. WE SHOW THAT AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE CORE RESULTS AND THE ENSUING CONTRIBUTIONS CAN BE GAINED FROM THE STUDY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE EULER EQUATIONS. WE ARGUE THAT THE EXISTING LITERATURE INCORPORATES MANY RELEVANT ASPECTS; HOWEVER, POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TEND TO HINGE ON SEVERAL KNIFE-EDGE ASSUMPTIONS. THEREFORE, FUTURE RESEARCH OUGHT TO FOCUS MORE ON IDEA-BASED ENDOGENOUS GROWTH MODELS TO CHECK THE ROBUSTNESS OF POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS. MOREOVER, THE INCLUSION OF HITHERTO UNEXPLORED TYPES OF GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE, E.G. ON THE 'RULE OF LAW', WOULD BE DESIRABLE.
982	THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE FORMS OF MARRIAGE VALID IN THE CZECH LANDS FROM THE END OF THE 18TH CENTURY TO THE PRESENT. BEFORE THE FAMILY LAW ACT CAME INTO EFFECT ON 1 JANUARY 1950, IT WAS POSSIBLE TO CONCLUDE A MARRIAGE BEFORE A BODY OF A CHURCH OR RELIGIOUS SOCIETY. THIS ALTERNATIVE FORM OF STATE RECOGNITION OF MARRIAGE WAS REINSTATED AFTER THE REIMPLEMENTATION OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, EFFECTIVE 1 JULY 1992. HOWEVER, THE NEW DRAFT CIVIL CODE INTRODUCES A COMPULSORY CIVIL MARRIAGE. THIS RULE CONTRADICTS THE TRADITIONAL REGULATION THAT EXISTED IN THE CZECH LANDS AND REPRESENTS AN UNNECESSARY LIMITATION ON THE FREEDOM OF CITIZENS WITH RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.
983	THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE ON STATE CAPACITY BY DEVELOPING A METHOD THAT YIELDS AN INDEX OF STATE CAPACITY WITH FAR MORE COMPREHENSIVE DATA COVERAGE ACROSS TIME AND COUNTRIES THAN HAS BEEN POSSIBLE PREVIOUSLY. UNLIKE NARROWER MEASURES OF FISCAL CAPACITY OR LEGAL CAPACITY, THE INDEX IS MORE COMPREHENSIVE, USING DATA FROM THE VARIETIES OF DEMOCRACY DATASET ON FISCAL CAPACITY, A STATE'S CONTROL OVER ITS TERRITORY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC GOODS USED TO SUPPORT MARKETS. LIKE THE PREVIOUS LITERATURE, IT DEMONSTRATES THAT THE HISTORICAL PREVALENCE OF WARFARE PREDICTS STATE CAPACITY. SEVERAL EXERCISES ARE PERFORMED TO DEMONSTRATE THE VALIDITY OF THE INDEX IN MEASURING STATE CAPACITY.
984	TAX EXTRACTION IS OFTEN LOW IN ABSOLUTIST REGIMES. WHY ARE ABSOLUTISTS UNABLE TO CONVERT POWER INTO REVENUE? SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE FROM IMPERIAL CHINA, WE EXPLAIN THIS PUZZLE WITH A PRINCIPAL-AGENT MODEL WHICH REVEALS THAT ABSOLUTISTS, UNCONSTRAINED BY RULE OF LAW AND UNABLE TO COMMIT TO NOT PREDATING ON THEIR TAX-COLLECTING AGENTS (AND THE MASSES), MAY FIND IT OPTIMAL TO SETTLE FOR A LOW WAGE-LOW TAX EQUILIBRIUM, WHILE PERMITTING AGENTS TO KEEP EXTRA, UNMONITORED TAXES. OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT LOW INVESTMENT IN ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY IS A CONSCIOUS CHOICE FOR AN ABSOLUTIST SINCE IT SUBSTITUTES FOR CREDIBLE COMMITMENT TO REFRAIN FROM CONFISCATION FROM ITS AGENTS.
985	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES DETERMINANTS OF INFORMAL ECONOMY. BY USING QUALITATIVE ASPECTS OF TAX SYSTEMS, FIRST, WE CREATE A SMITHIAN' TAX SYSTEM INDEX BASED ON ADAM SMITH'S FOUR MAXIMS. THEN, USING THIS INDEX AND OTHER CONTROL VARIABLES, WE STUDY DETERMINANTS OF INFORMAL ECONOMY. WE USE UNIQUE PANEL DATA SET THAT IS CONSTRUCTED BY USING VARIOUS SOURCES. AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE ENDOGENEITY OF TAX BURDEN AND GDP PER CAPITA, OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT SMITHIAN' TAX SYSTEM INDEX DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT INFORMAL ECONOMY. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT RULE OF LAW, COMPLEXITY OF A TAX SYSTEM AND TAX BURDEN AFFECT INFORMAL ECONOMY NEGATIVELY, WHILE LABOUR MARKET REGULATIONS AFFECT POSITIVELY.
986	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO WEAVE A DEBATE BETWEEN THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY OF RONALD DWORKIN AND CONSTITUTIONAL PROCEDURALISM OF JOHN HART ELY, ESPECIALLY REGARDING THE ROLE THAT THE JUDICIARY COULD LEGITIMATELY EXERCISE IN A DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. THEREFORE, INITIALLY, WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION OF DWORKIN-THE MORAL READING OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LAW AS INTEGRITY-AND CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN OF DEMOCRACY. POSTERIORLY, IT WILL ADDRESS THE BASIC THEORY OF JOHN HART ELY AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCEDURALISM. THE LAST ISSUE TO BE DISCOURSED IS THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY IN DWORKIN'S VIEW AND ELY'S AND THEIR OBJECTIONS TO IDEAS DEVELOPED BY BOTH AUTHORS.
987	AS IN PREVIOUS YEARS, PANAMA'S RATE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH IN 2012 WAS THE HIGHEST IN LATIN AMERICA. PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT IS LED BY POLITICAL ENTREPRENEURS WHO HAVE MANAGED TO MAINTAIN AND BUILD ON THE MOMENTUM OF THE PANAMANIAN ECONOMY, BUT WHO HAVE NOT BEEN CAPABLE OF CONTROLLING THE EXCESSES OF AN EXCLUSIONARY POLITICAL SYSTEM AND OF A WEAK RULE OF LAW. ECONOMIC INEQUALITY AND POLITICAL EXCLUSION HAVE STIRRED VIOLENT PROTESTS IN 2012 THAT SEEM RATHER INEXPLICABLE IN THE LIGHT OF THE ECONOMIC BOOM. THIS PAPER SUGGESTS THAT CONFLICT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH ARE CLOSELY RELATED AND THAT, CONTRARY TO THE POPULAR OPINION, WHAT HARMS PANAMANIAN POLITICS IS THE ECONOMY.
988	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE CONCEPT OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN A CONTEMPORARY AUSTRALIAN CONTEXT. IT PONDERS THE MEANING OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE RULE OF LAW. IT EXAMINES THE ROLE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATIONS AND PROTECTIONS OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN AUSTRALIA, AT STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS. IT REFLECTS ON THE MODERN THREATS TO JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, SUCH AS THE MANNER IN WHICH COURTS ARE FUNDED AND RESOURCED AND THE PRESSURES ON JUDGES ARISING OUT OF MEDIA PORTRAYAL OF THE COURTS. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE CONTINUES TO BE A CENTRAL PILLAR OF A FREE AND DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY.
989	PREVIOUS STUDIES ON STATE'S INFRASTRUCTURAL POWER ASSUME THAT THE STATE IS COMPOSED OF FORMAL BUREAUCRATIC AND COERCIVE INSTITUTIONS. THIS STUDY EXPLORES A NEW FORMAT OF INFRASTRUCTURAL POWER, TERMED THE "LOCAL STATE ADHOCRACY," BY USING CHINA'S STABILITY MAINTENANCE APPARATUSES AS A CASE. CONFIGURED THROUGH THE STATE'S REORDERING OF INSTITUTIONAL AND SOCIAL RESOURCES BUT OPERATING IN RATHER FLEXIBLE AND IMPROMPTUS MANNERS, THE LOCAL STATE ADHOCRACY IS ROOTED IN THE CCP'S POLITICAL TRADITION OF DEPLOYING INFORMAL AND EXPEDIENT ORGANIZATIONS FOR POLICY IMPLEMENTATION IN A LESS INSTITUTIONALIZED CONTEXT. IT GENERATES NEW CAPABILITY OF THE STATE BUT ALSO WEAKENS THE RULE OF LAW AND INSTITUTIONALIZATION.
990	KANT'S CRITICAL PHILOSOPHY IS NOT ONLY A CRITIQUE OF THE FACULTIES OF HUMAN MIND, BUT ALSO IS A CRITIQUE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL POLITICAL CONDITIONS OF HUMAN BEINGS. THE DOGMATISM IN METAPHYSICS IS RELATED TO DESPOTISM IN POLITICS, AND SKEPTICISM TO ANARCHISM. IT IS INDICATED THAT CRITICAL PHILOSOPHY, AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO DOGMATISM AND SKEPTICISM, MUST HAVE A COUNTERPART IN POLITICS. THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO REVEAL THE SIMILARITY IN THE SPIRITUAL STYLE BETWEEN KANT'S CRITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND HIS POLITICAL THOUGHT. THE POLITICAL EXPRESSION OF CRITICAL PHILOSOPHY IS REPUBLICANISM. IT HAS THREE ELEMENTS: POLITICAL AUTHORITY, RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL FREEDOM. ITS ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE IS PERPETUAL PEACE.
991	MILITANT DEMOCRACY IS AN ATTEMPT TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY AGAINST TOTALITARIAN PARTIES THAT WOULD USE DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES TO RISE TO POWER. THIS ARTICLE IS FOCUSED ON THE CONSISTENCY OF THE CONCEPT OF 'MILITANT DEMOCRACY'. I ARGUE THAT WHAT MILITANT DEMOCRACY DEFENDS IS NOT THE DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURE ITSELF BUT RATHER CERTAIN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW, AND THAT THOSE ELEMENTS MAY IN FACT BE COMPROMISED BY DEMOCRACY. THIS APPLIES BOTH IF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURE IS CONCERNED AND IF DEMOCRACY IS INTERPRETED AS A REFLECTION OF THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. THOSE ELEMENTS MAY BE UPHELD, BUT DEMOCRACY IS TO BE MITIGATED RATHER THAN FORTIFIED IN ORDER TO DO SO.
992	DISCRETION IS A REALITY IN THE LEGAL MODEL IN WHICH WE ARE FRAMED AND, ASTONISHINGLY, A LARGE PART OF THE LAWYERS TEND TO OMIT BEFORE SUCH A PROBLEM, WHICH ONLY DEMONSTRATES THE PHILOSOPHICAL WEAKNESS IN WHICH WE FIND OURSELVES, AS THE " PREVAILING UNDERSTANDING " AIMS THE IDEA OF A FREE CONVICTION AND LEGAL DECISION, BOTH MEMBERS OF DISCRETION AND INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. SUCH AN UNDERSTANDING ONLY IS GIVEN BECAUSE THERE ARE EQUIVOCAL UNDERSTANDINGS ABOUT LEGAL POSITIVISM, NAMELY, THE LACK OF FREEDOM TO JUDICIAL DECISIONS. THE AIM IS TO SHOW THAT, FROM THE OUTSET, THE LEGAL POSITIVISM HAS DISCRETION AS FUNDAMENTAL FEATURES.
993	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A PROGRESS REPORT OF THE INVESTIGATION "COMPLEXITY OF THE CITIZEN EDUCATION IN THE RULE OF LAW IN COLOMBIA" WITHIN THE PHD IN EDUCATIONAL SCIENCES AT UNIVERSITY SIMON BOLIVAR, ARTICULATED TO THE RESEARCH "SOCIAL COMPLEXITY OF EDUCATION AND CULTURE". THIS, IN ORDER TO DEVELOP AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOCIAL COMPLEXITY AND ITS INTERACTION WITH CATEGORIES, SUCH AS EDUCATION AND CIVIC CULTURE; INTERACTION IN WHICH LAW AND EDUCATION COME TOGETHER AS A PAIRING OF STRENGTHS WHICH GENERATE CIVIC CULTURE THAT ALLOWS HORIZONS AND A DIFFERENT QUALITY OF LIFE. THE REPORT RESTS ON THE EDUCATIONAL ELEMENTS THAT FROM THE COMPLEX THOUGHT CAN AFFECT A FORMATION OF CITIZENS.
994	THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT AL-TABARI'S HISTORY OF THE PROPHETS AND THE KINGS PROVIDES A FREE RIDER-ANALYSIS OF THE DECLINE OF ABBASID STATE POWER. AL-TABARI'S HISTORICAL ANALYSIS CONSIDERS STATE POLICY ON LAND TAX, AND RELIGION AS A LEGAL NORM RELATED TO THE SOCIAL CONTRACT BETWEEN THE HEAD OF STATE AND THE LANDLORDS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT AL-TABARI SAW THE MISAHA TAX SYSTEM AND 'RULE OF LAW' AS THE PRINCIPAL CONDITIONS FOR IMPERIAL RULE, AND THAT AL-TABARI'S HISTORY ALREADY PROVIDES AN ANSWER TO MODERN HISTORIANS' QUESTIONS AS TO WHY THE ABBASID STATE CRUMBLED, AND WHAT ROLE RELIGION PLAYED IN THE POLITICAL ECONOMY.
995	THE PAPER DESCRIBES THE GROWING ROLE OF LAWYERS IN THE FIELD OF HUMAN AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, SPECIFICALLY IN THE EUROPEAN MULTILEVEL SYSTEM. FIRSTLY, THE PAPER PROPOSES A CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE LAWYERS' POWER AS POLITICAL POWER, ALSO UNDERLYING THE S.C. "SOCIAL FUNCTION" AIMED AT GUARANTEEING HUMAN RIGHTS AND EMPOWERING THE RULE OF LAW. THEN A MORE GENERAL REFLECTION ON THE RELATED TRIAL NATURE OF RIGHTS WILL BE DEVELOPED, SPECIFICALLY TAKING IN CONSIDERATION FRANCESCO VIOLA'S APPROACH TO HUMAN RIGHTS AS SOCIAL PRACTICE. CONSEQUENTLY, THE BOTTOM-UP TRAJECTORY OF HUMAN AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS WILL BE BETTER DEFINED, POINTING OUT THE STRATEGIC ROLE OF LITIGATION AND LAWYERS IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS.
996	THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL ADOPTED RESOLUTION 2270 AGAINST NORTH KOREA'S FOURTH NUCLEAR TEST ON JANUARY 6, 2016, AND ITS SUBSEQUENT ROCKET LAUNCH. THIS RESOLUTION CONTAINS TOUGHER SANCTION MEASURES THAN ANY OTHERS ADOPTED IN THE PAST, BUT IS NOT EXPECTED TO EFFECTIVELY STOP NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM. THIS ESSAY ANALYZES THE CRITICAL LOOPHOLE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN GLOBAL SOCIETY REGARDING NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION SYSTEMS AS WELL AS REGIONAL GOVERNANCE. IT FURTHER SUGGESTS LEGAL AND POLICY OPTIONS TO RESOLVE THIS NUCLEAR DILEMMA. THE PARTIES CONCERNED ARE ASKED TO ALTER THE STATUS QUO OF HOSTILE CO-EXISTENCE AND INSTEAD REVERT TO THE SPIRIT OF THE GENEVA AGREED FRAMEWORK.
997	A MATTER OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW IS THE JUDICIAL PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. DESPITE THIS, THE LITERATURE HAS NOT WRITTEN MUCH ON THE SUBJECT. WHAT IS PROPOSED IN THE FOLLOWING PAPER IS THAT THE IDEA OF JUDICIAL GUARANTEE IS NOT ONLY CRUCIAL TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, BUT ALSO THAT THROUGH THE JUDICIAL PRAXIS IS GOING TO GIVE FORM AND CONTENT THEREOF. THEREFORE, YOU SHOULD TAKE SPECIAL CARE IN ITS INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN SO THAT THE PROCESS OF CONSTITUTIONAL ADJUDICATION IS LEAST HARMFUL TO THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE. THIS IS NOT TRIVIAL, AS THIS IS THE OTHER SOURCE OF LEGITIMACY RESORTING TO CONTEMPORARY CONSTITUTIONS.
998	THIS PAPER EXAMINES WHETHER SHAREHOLDER-OWNED MFIS FINANCIALLY AND SOCIALLY PERFORM BETTER THAN NGOS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA). WE ALSO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN ALTERING MFIS' INCENTIVES AND BEHAVIOR IN DETERMINING OUTREACH. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT NGOS ARE MORE PROFITABLE AND HAVE BETTER OUTREACH THAN BANKS AND COOPERATIVES. WHILE A WEAK RULE OF LAW FAVORS RELATIONSHIP-BASED EXCHANGES AND THUS, RESULTS IN NGO SUPERIORITY, STRONGER INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY MAY ENCOURAGE BANKS TO CATER TO MORE BORROWERS, HENCE, SHAREHOLDER-OWNED MFIS DO NOT SOCIALLY PERFORM DIFFERENTLY FROM NGOS. OVERALL, THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT NGOS ARE THE BEST CONDUITS OF MICROFINANCE IN SSA. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
999	THIS ARTICLE OUTLINES AND EXPLORES SOME RECENT CHANGES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE PRACTICE AND ORGANIZATION OF WESTERN INTELLIGENCE. AMERICAN CONCERN WITH ORGANIZATIONAL REFORM OF ITS INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IS OUTLINED AND CONTRASTED. OTHER TRANSATLANTIC COMPARISONS ARE MADE, IN PARTICULAR CONCERNING DEBATES ABOUT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THE LEGACY OF BRITISH EXPERIENCE IN NORTHERN IRELAND FOR ATTITUDES TO TORTURE AND PRESERVATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IS EXAMINED. THE BRITISH EXPERIENCE OF 'TALKING TO TERRORISTS' IS ALSO EXPLORED. PROSPECTS FOR, AND EXPECTATIONS OF, THE FUTURE, INCLUDING THE LIKELIHOOD OF CATASTROPHIC TERRORISM ARE DISCUSSED. THE ARGUMENT IS MADE THAT THE 'WAR ON TERROR' IS A 'BATTLE OF IDEAS' AND VALUES.
