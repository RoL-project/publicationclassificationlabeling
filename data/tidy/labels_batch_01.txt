The papers conclude that despite formal fulfillment of ICTY conditionality requirements, the goal of using ICTY as a tool to establish the rule of law in Serbia has failed due to a lack of norm diffusion and deficiencies in the legal operation of the tribunal, as well as a lack of fruitful domestic grounds for EU demands and ICTY's work.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Tribunal_for_the_former_Yugoslavia
