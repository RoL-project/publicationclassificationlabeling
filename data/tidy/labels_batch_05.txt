The papers argue that collusion is not an aberration but rather exemplary of British state counterinsurgency violence.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_collusion

It examines the factors contributing to the unchecked power of African presidents, reviews attempts to limit impunity through immunity provisions, and concludes that the reforms did not adequately address the problem. The papers also suggest various national and international strategies to enhance presidential accountability and end the culture of impunity.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_absolutism

996	Democracy Performance	Performance Differences in Younger Democracies	Democracy; Performance; Political Competitors; Credible Promises; Corruption; Rule of Law; Bureaucratic Quality; Media Restrictions; Public Investment; Clientelist Policies	This cluster of papers examines the systematic performance differences between younger and older democracies, attributing them to the inability of political competitors to make broadly credible pre-electoral promises to voters. Younger democracies exhibit more corruption, less rule of law, lower bureaucratic quality and secondary school enrollment, more media restrictions, and higher spending on public investment and government workers. The inability to make credible promises leads to preference for clientelist policies, underprovision of nontargeted goods, overprovision of targeted transfers, and excessive rent seeking.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy
997	Mobile Phone Governance	Mobile Phone's Role in Improving Environmental Governance	Mobile Phone Penetration; Environmental Sustainability; Governance Dynamics; CO2 Emissions; Sub-Saharan African Countries; Policy Thresholds; Regulation Quality; Government Effectiveness; Corruption Control; Rule of Law	This cluster of papers focuses on the role of mobile phones in improving environmental governance, particularly in Sub-Saharan African countries. The papers assess the impact of mobile phone penetration on governance dynamics, policy thresholds for CO2 emissions, and the relationship between mobile phone usage and factors such as political stability, regulation quality, government effectiveness, corruption control, and the rule of law. The findings provide critical thresholds of mobile phone penetration that complement governance dynamics to reduce CO2 emissions.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone_penetration_in_Africa
998	ECJ Rulings	Impact of European Court of Justice Rulings on Euroscepticism	European Court of Justice; Euroscepticism; National Sovereignty; EU Integration; Supranational Decisions; Rule of Law; Polity Scepticism; EU Norms; Democracy Dissatisfaction; Legitimacy Scrutiny	This cluster of papers explores the impact of European Court of Justice (ECJ) rulings on Euroscepticism and dissatisfaction with national democracy. The research theorizes that supranational decisions taken by the ECJ can increase 'polity scepticism' by cueing citizens regarding the effects of EU integration on the perception of diluted sovereignty. Empirical evidence supports the theory, establishing a significant causal effect of ECJ rulings on Euroscepticism and dissatisfaction with democracy. The findings suggest that interventionist action by EU institutions may backfire by increasing scrutiny of the EU's legitimacy and undermining polity support.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice

It examines the development and outcomes of the protests, drawing on Political Opportunity Theory to identify enabling conditions such as political freedoms, alignment of political elites with protesters, and low risk of state repression. The analysis highlights how these political opportunities were established in Korean society, allowing citizens to take effective collective action.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016–17_South_Korean_protests
